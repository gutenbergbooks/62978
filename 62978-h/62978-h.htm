<h2><a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you love the quiet of the
country&mdash;the real quiet which is not silence at all, but the
blending of a myriad scarce-perceptible sounds&mdash;you will get
it in Windlecombe, heaped measure, pressed down, and running
over, year in and year out.</p>
<p>The village lies just where Arun river breaks the green
rampart of the Sussex Downs.&nbsp; To the west, the lowest
cottages dwindle almost to the water&rsquo;s brink.&nbsp;
Northward and eastward, the highest buildings stand afar off,
clear cut against the blue wall of the sky; while in between,
filling the deep, steep combe, church and inn and every kind of
dwelling-house, little or big, huddle together under their thatch
and old red tiles, with the village green in their midst, and a
thread of white road rippling through them all and up the steep
combe-side till it is lost in the sunny waste of the hills.</p>
<p>But there is no way through Windlecombe.&nbsp; From the market
town four miles off, the road <a name="pagexii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xii</span>is good enough; and good it remains
until it reaches the highest human outpost of the village.&nbsp;
But there it suddenly changes to a mere cart-track, soon to
vanish altogether in the green sward of the Down.&nbsp; And
therein lies Windlecombe&rsquo;s chiefest blessing.&nbsp; Far
away on the great main road, when the wind is southerly, we can
hear the motor-bugles calling, and see pale comet-beams careering
through the night.&nbsp; But these things come no nearer.&nbsp;
At rare intervals, perhaps, a stray juggernaut will descend upon
us, and demand of some placid rustic the nearest way to
Land&rsquo;s End or Aberdeen, returning disgusted on its tracks
when it learns that there is only one road from here to anywhere,
and that the road it came.&nbsp; But these ear-splitting,
malodorous happenings are few and far between.&nbsp; At all other
times, Windlecombe wears the quiet of the hills about it like a
garment.&nbsp; The dust of the highway has no soaring ambition to
whiten the hedgerows, or fill the cottagers&rsquo; cabbages with
grit.&nbsp; It still keeps to its ancient, lowly work of
smoothing the path for man and beast; and our children can play
in it unterrorised, our old dogs lie in it at their slumberous
ease.</p>
<p>How wild and quiet the place is, you can only realise by
living in it from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s <a
name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>end, as
has been my own privilege for longer than I care to compute. For
how many ages a human settlement has existed in this wooded,
sun-flooded cleft of the Downs, it is impossible to hazard a
guess. Windlecombe is mentioned in <i>Domesday</i>, but the
stones of the old church proclaim it as belonging to times more
distant still. Be that as it may, its clustered roofs and grey
church tower have long been reckoned in the traditions of wild
life as part and parcel of the eternal hills.&nbsp; Birds
frequent Windlecombe as they haunt the beech-woods that hang upon
the sides of the combe. They use the rick-yards and gardens, the
very streets even, as they use the glades in the woodlands or the
verges of the brooks. You may come out of a winter&rsquo;s
morning and see a heron flapping slowly out of your paddock, or
listen to a pheasant&rsquo;s trumpeting on the other side of the
hedge. And in early summer you can sit on the garden bench, and,
looking up into the dim elm labyrinth overhead, watch a green
woodpecker at work, cutting the hole for his nest straight and
true into the heart of the wood. That the thrushes sing all day
long from Michaelmas to Midsummer Day, that in June you cannot
sleep for the nightingales, that there is never an hour of
daylight all the year round when a lark <a
name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>is not
carolling against the blue or stormy grey above the
village&mdash;these things you take as part of your rightful
daily fare, and are content.</p>
<p>But life in an English village derives its charm only in part
from its intimacy with wild Nature and all her wonders and
beauties, indispensable as these are to the daily lives of most
thinking, working men. There is no error so disastrous, humanly
speaking, as that which leads a man to seek happiness or
sublimity out of the beaten track of his fellows. Neighbourhood,
the daily interchange of thought and word and kindly deed, is a
necessity for all healthy human life, and the natural medium of
all true advancement.&nbsp; And nowhere will you find it of such
sturdy growth, rooted in such nourishing, yet temperate soil,
than in the villages of modern England.</p>
<p>Yet here it is necessary to discriminate, to mark conditions.
If one&rsquo;s duty towards one&rsquo;s neighbour assumes a real
and prime world&rsquo;s importance in village life, it is equally
true that all men are not alike fit to be villagers, nor all
villages to be accounted neighbourly. It is an essential part of
the life I would describe in these pages that both the people and
the place should depend for existence on the day&rsquo;s work;
work done, as far as may be, on the soil from which all <a
name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>sprang, and
to which all some day must return. The show villages, the little
lodging-letting communities that are to be found here and there,
must be excluded from the argument. Nor can men of private means,
however modest, find a natural place in the true villager ranks.
Where to all men life is a series of laborious days, tired
evenings, dreamless nights, you, lolling in the sunshine, or
playing at work, or more fatal still, working at play, will be
for ever a public anomaly. You will get civility, a patient,
dignified tolerance from all. But you will not have a neighbour:
though you live until your feet have graven their mark into every
stone of the place, you will be a stranger in a strange land.</p>
<p>For my part, such as my work is, I have done it, every stroke,
in Windlecombe for half a lifetime back, and may claim to have
fairly won my villagership. And what it is worth to me&mdash;how
it is sweetened by daily touch of kind hearts and grip of clean
hands; what the country sunshine means, filtering through the
vine-leaves of my workroom window; and what the song of the robin
that sits on the ivied gate-post without, or, in winter-time,
comes fluttering and tapping at the old bull&rsquo;s-eye panes
for crumbs; how the daily walk, in wood or meadow or by
riverside, <a name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvi</span>brings ever its new marvel or revelation of unimagined
beauty; and how, above all, the lives of the quaint, courageous,
clever folk, in whose midst Destiny has thrown me, overbrim with
all traits human, delectably mortal, divinely
out-of-place&mdash;these, and many other aspects of villagership,
I have here tried to set down in plain words and meaning,
believing that what has proved of interest and profit to one very
human, always erring, often doubting soul, may do the like for
others, though journeying by widely sundered tracks.</p>

1</span>JANUARY</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> just been to the house-door,
to take a look at the winter&rsquo;s night. A change is coming,
the long frost nears its end&mdash;so the old ferryman has told
me every morning for a fortnight back, and his perseverance as a
prophet has been rewarded at last. As I flung the heavy oak door
back, a breath of air struck upon my face warm, it seemed, as
summer. All about me in the grey darkness there was an
indescribable stir and awakening of life. The moon no longer
stared down out of the black sky, a wicked, venomous-bright
beauty on her full-fed, rather supercilious face: now she wore a
scarf of mist upon her brows, and looked nun-like, dim-eyed, and
mild. The stars had lost their cruel glitter. I stepped forth,
and felt the grass yield beneath my tread&mdash;the first time
for near a month past. And as I stood wondering and rejoicing at
it all, some night-bird lanced by overhead, a note of the same
relief and gladness unmistakable in its shrill, jangling cry.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Hard
weather in the country has a thousand enjoyments and interests
for those who care to look for them; but when the frost holds
relentlessly week after week, as it has done this January, the
grimmer side of things comes obtrusively to the fore. There is
too much shadow for the light. It is as though you rejoiced in
the beauty of sunset beams on a wall, and it were the wall of a
torture-house. You lie awake at night, and in the death-quiet
stillness, hear the measured footfall of death&mdash;a dull,
reiterated thud on the frozen ground beneath the holly-hedge,
each sound denoting that yet another roosting thrush or starling
has given up the unequal fight. Roaming through the lanes in your
warm overcoat and thick-soled boots, you note the loveliness of
the hoar-frost, at one step dazzling white, and at the next aglow
with prismatic colour; and turning the corner, you come upon the
gipsy&rsquo;s tent, and realise that, while you lay snug and
warm, nothing but that pitiful screen of old rent rags has stood
between human beings and the terror of a winter&rsquo;s
night.</p>
<p>On one of the hardest days I met the old vicar of Windlecombe,
and regaled him with the story of how I had just passed along the
river-way as the tide was falling; how, at full flood, at the
pause of the waters, the frost had sheathed the river with ice;
and how, when the tide began <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>to go down, this crystal stratum had
remained aloft, held up by the myriad reed-stems; until at
length, loosened by the sunbeams, it had fallen sheet by sheet to
the wildest, most ravishing music, each icy tympanum, as it fell,
ringing a different, dear, sweet note. And, in return for my
word-picturing, the old man gave me a story of the same times to
match it; how he had just learnt that certain ill-clad, ill-fed
children&mdash;whom the law compelled to tramp every morning from
Redesdown, a little farming hamlet miles away over the frozen
hills, to the nearest school at Windlecombe, and tramp back again
every night&mdash;were given a daily penny between the three of
them for their midday meal; and how, as often as not, the bread
they needed went unbought from the village store, because of the
lure of the intervening sweetstuff shop. Later, in the red light
of sundown, I met those children going home, as I had often met
them, plodding one behind the other, heads down to the bitter
blast. Each wore a great new woollen muffler, and had his pockets
stuffed. I knew who had cared for them, and my heart smote me.
Somehow the pure austerity of the evening&mdash;the radiant light
ahead, the white grace of the hills about me, the star-gemmed
azure above&mdash;no longer brought the old elation. The jingle
of my skates, as they hung from my arm, took on a <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>disagreeable
sound of fetters. Though I carried them many a time after that, I
never put them away without the honest wish that I should use
them no more.</p>
<p>But lucidly, these long spells of unremitting frost are rare
in our country. Ordinary give-and-take winter&rsquo;s
weather&mdash;the alternation of cold and warmth, gloom and
sunshine, wind and calm&mdash;brings little hardship to any
living thing.&nbsp; Country children have a wonderful way of
thriving and being happy, even though their diet is mainly
bread-and-dripping and separated milk.&nbsp; As for wild life, we
need expend no commiseration on any creature that can burrow; and
while there are berries in the hedgerows, and water in the
brooks, no bird will come to harm.</p>
<p>It is curious to see how Nature ekes out her winter supplies,
doling out rations, as it were, from day to day. If the whole
berry harvest came to ripe maturity at the same season, or were
of like attractiveness, it would be squandered and exhausted by
the spendthrift, happy-go-lucky hordes of birds, long before the
winter was through. But many things are designed to prevent this.
Under the threat of starvation, all birds will eat berries; but a
great proportion of them will do so only as a last resource. At
first it is the hawthorn fruit that goes. The soft flesh of the
may-berry will yield to the weakest <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>bill, and the whole crop ripens
together in early winter. But even here Nature provides against
the risk of immediate waste, that will mean starvation hereafter.
The missel-thrushes have been given a bad name because each of
them takes possession of some well-loaded stretch of hedgerow,
and spends the whole day in driving off other birds. Yet, on this
habit of the greedy missel, depends not only his own future
sustenance but that of all the rest. For all his agility, he
cannot prevent each bird snatching at least enough to keep life
going, and while he is so busy, he has himself no chance for
gluttony.</p>
<p>Other berry supplies, such as the privet and holly, seem to be
preserved to the last because they are universally distasteful,
though nourishing at a pinch. But it is the hips, or
rose-berries, which provide the best example of Nature&rsquo;s
way of conserving the lives of birds throughout hard weather
against their own foolish, squandering instinct. These berries do
not ripen all at once, whether late or early in the season. On
every bush, the scarlet hips soften in regular, long-drawn-out
succession, some being ready in early winter, and some not until
well on in the new year. When the hip is ripe, the tenderest beak
can get at its viscid fruit; but until it begins to soften, there
is hardly a bird that can deal with it. The rose-berries, with
their scanty but never-failing <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>stores, are really the mainstay of all
in hard times. It is doubtful, indeed, whether the birds that die
wholesale in prolonged frosty weather, are killed by hunger at
all. Probably their death is due rather to thirst. So long as the
brooks run, bird life can hold against the bitterest times. But
once silence has settled down over the country-side&mdash;the
only real silence of the year, when all the streams are locked up
at their source&mdash;then begins the steady footfall under the
holly-hedge, and you must needs turn from the crimson sunset
light upon the wall.</p>
<p>I have shut the heavy old house-door, and got back to my table
by the workroom fire. The thaw has come in earnest now. I can
hear the drip of the melting rime in the garden, far and near.
The warm west wind is beginning to sigh down the chimney. The
logs simmer and glow, but not with the greedy brightness of
frost-bound nights.</p>
<p>It is on these long winter evenings that Solitude comes into
her kingdom. Men are not all made alike, nor is solitude with all
a voluntary condition, at least a self-imposed necessity, as it
is with me&mdash;a something that I must fashion out of my own
will and abnegation, weave about me as the tunnel-spider weaves
her lair. In this ancient house the walls are thick, yet not so
thick but that an ear-strain will just trip the echo of <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>far-off
laughter.&nbsp; If I but drew that curtain and set the door ajar,
I could catch a murmur of voices like the sound of bee-hives in
summer dark; and a dozen strides along the stone-flagged passage
would yield me what I may not take for hours to come&mdash;tried
and meet companionship, the flint-and-steel play of bandied jest,
my own to hold, if I can, in brisk exchange of nerving,
heartening thought.&nbsp; But these things in their season.&nbsp;
Mine now it is to dip the grey goose-quill, to gird up for the
long tramp over the foolscap-country before me&mdash;that
trackless white desert where I must lay a trail to be followed,
whether by many or few or none, or with what pleasure or
weariness, I may never certainly know.&nbsp; For the writer is
like a sower, that is ever sowing and passing on.&nbsp; He can
seldom do more than take a hurried, fleeting shoulder-glimpse at
the harvest behind him, nor see who reaps, if haply it be reaped
at all.</p>
<p>Scratching away in the cosy fireside quiet of the old room,
there comes to me at length a sound from the chimney-corner, to
which I must needs listen, no matter what twist or quirk of
syntax holds me in thrall.&nbsp; You often hear aged country folk
complain that the crickets no longer sing on the hearth, as they
used to do in their childhood.&nbsp; My own crickets have always
seemed to sing blithely enough, too blithely at times to <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>help one
forward with a difficult task.&nbsp; But I had always been glad
to accept the statement as one more proof of the decadence of
modern times.&nbsp; Hobnobbing one winter&rsquo;s evening,
however, with the old ferryman in his riverside den, and noting
how merrily the crickets were chirping in his chimney-corner, I
wondered to hear him give way to this same lament.&nbsp; Then,
for the first time, I realised that not the crickets, but his old
ears, were at fault.&nbsp; Though the little smoke-blackened
cabin rang with their music, the old man, who would, on the
loudest night, have heard a ferry-call from the other side of the
water instantly, failed now to grip the high-pitched sound.&nbsp;
And this set me to philosophising.&nbsp; When the crickets cease
to pipe in my own chimney-corner, then, and not till then, I will
admit I am growing old.</p>
<p>But though we speak of the chirp or pipe of the cricket and
grasshopper, it is well to remember that neither these, nor any
other insects, possess a true voice.&nbsp; It would be nearer the
fact to call the cricket a fiddler than a piper.&nbsp; For it is
by sitting and drawing the corrugated rib of his wing-case to and
fro over the sharp edge of the wing beneath, that his shrill note
is developed.&nbsp; And it is only the male cricket who can
chirp.&nbsp; The female carries upon her no trace of any fiddling
contrivance.&nbsp; When all things <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>were made, and made in couples, on the
females of at least one numerous species, it is pleasant to
remark, a significant and commendable silence was imposed.</p>
<p>Solitude by a fireside in an old country dwelling, the
murmurous night without, and, within, the steady clear glow of
candles made by your own hands out of wax from your own hives, it
would be strange if the evening&rsquo;s work failed to get itself
done cleverly and betimes.&nbsp; Pleasant as it is to all penmen
to be achieving, there is no depth of satisfaction like that of
leaving off.&nbsp; Then, not to return incontinently to the
sober, colour-fast world of fact, but to stay in your
dream-country, idling awhile by the roadside, is one of the great
compensations of this most exacting of lives.</p>
<p>Your tale is done.&nbsp; You have scrawled &lsquo;The
End&rsquo; at the bottom of the sheet, and thrown it with the
others.&nbsp; You have turned your chair to the fire, put up your
slippered feet on the andiron, and have filled your most
comfortable pipe.&nbsp; The end it is, in very truth, for all who
will read the tale; but for you there will never be an end, just
as there never was a beginning to it.&nbsp; Unbidden now, and not
to be gainsaid even if you had the mind, your dream-children live
on in the town or country nook you made for them; live on,
increase and multiply, finish their peck of dirt, add to the
world&rsquo;s store either of folly or sanctity, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>come to their
graves at last, each by his own inexorable road, and each leaving
the seed of another tale behind.</p>
<p>To the enviable reader, when, after much water-spilling and
cracking of crowns, Jack has got his Jill, and the wedding-bells
are lin-lan-loning behind the dropt curtain, there is the
satisfaction of certainty that so much love, and one pair of
hearts at least, are safe from further chance and change in the
whirligig of life.&nbsp; But to the teller of the tale, there is
no such assurance.&nbsp; Just as his dream-children came out of
an immortality he did not devise, so will they persist through an
eternity not of his controlling; and for ever they will be
subject to the same odds of bliss or disaster as any stranger
that may pass his door.&nbsp; Yet, being only human, he will
nevertheless go on with his tales in the secret hope that Jove
may be caught napping, and a little heaven be brought down to
earth before its allotted time.&nbsp; For living in a world of
law and order&mdash;where even Omnipotence may not deny to every
cause its outcome&mdash;is too realistically like camping under
fire.&nbsp; The old fatalists had peace of mind because they
believed it availed nothing to crouch when the bullets screamed
overhead, nor even to dodge a spent shot.&nbsp; But to take
one&rsquo;s stand in the face of the myriad cross-purposes and
side-issues of an orderly universe, needs a vastly <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>different
temper.&nbsp; Perhaps it is just the secret longing in all hearts
to have at least a little make-believe of certitude&mdash;if
nowhere else but in the pages of a story&mdash;by which the art
of fiction so hugely thrives.</p>
<p>I have put out the candles, each shining under its little red
umbrella of paper, the better to see the joyous colour of the
fire.&nbsp; When drab thoughts come&mdash;those night-birds of
sombre feather&mdash;the pure untinctured glow from well-kindled
logs has a wonderful way of setting them to flight.&nbsp; Let
unassailable optimism make his fire of coals: for him of
questioning, craving, often craven heart, there is no warmth like
that from seasoned timber.&nbsp; Coals, with their dynamic
energy, their superfluity of smoke, their sudden incongruous jets
of flame, seem to be for ever insisting on facts you would fain
forget a while, much as you may admire them and depend on
them&mdash;the progress and competition of outer life.&nbsp; But
wood fires serve to draw the mind away from modernism in all its
phases.&nbsp; So that you burn the right kind of wood, and this
is important, your fireside thoughts need never leave the realm
of cheery retrospect.&nbsp; Good, seasoned logs of beech or ash
are the best.&nbsp; Oak has no half moods; it must make either a
furnace unapproachable, or smoulder away in dead, dull
embers.&nbsp; Elm gives poor comfort, and the slightest damp
appals it.&nbsp; <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Poplar is charity-fuel; burn it will, indeed, to good
purpose, but too explosively.&nbsp; There is no rest by a fire of
poplar: one must be for ever treading out or parrying the vagrant
sparks.</p>
<p>A joyous colour it is&mdash;the wavering amber light that
fills the old room now from the piled-up beechen logs; joyous,
yet having a sedate, ruminative tinge about it, like old
travellers&rsquo; tales of ancient times.&nbsp; Nor does the
colour appeal only to the eye: there seems to be a fragrance in
it.&nbsp; That this is no mere conceit but simple fact, I was
strangely reminded when I blew the candles out, and from the
smouldering wicks two long white ribbons of vapour were borne
away on the draught.&nbsp; The fragrance of the smoking wax
brought up a picture of the summer nights when the bees lay close
to fashion it.&nbsp; Round about the cluster in the pent-up hive
were thousands of little vats of brewing honey, each giving off a
steam that was the life-spirit of clover-fields and blue borage,
and sainfoin which spreads the hills with rose-red light.&nbsp;
All these mingled scents had got into the nature of the wax, and
now they were given off again in sweet-smelling vapour, such a
fragrance as you may rarely chance upon in certain foreign
churches, where the old ordinances yet prevail, and the candles
are still made from the pure product of the hives.</p>
<p>And it is the same with burning logs.&nbsp; Each <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>kind of wood
has its own essential odour, which pervades the room as though it
were soul and body with the light.&nbsp; You cannot separate the
two; no riding down of fancy will dissociate the flickering
gipsy-gold of the embers and the perfume of the simmering
bark.&nbsp; If these do not fill your mind with memories of the
green twilight of woodlands, of hours spent in leafy shadows of
forest-glades, then&mdash;then you are not made for a country
fireside, and were happier hobnobbing with Modernity by his
sooty, coal-fed hearth.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>It is not difficult to understand why indoor work is at most
times tolerable in cities, fair weather or foul.&nbsp; For in
cities earth and sky have long been driven out of their ancient
comradeship.&nbsp; Stifled by pavements and masonry, the earth
cannot feel the touch of the sunbeams, nor the air enrich itself
with the breath of the soil.&nbsp; The old glad interchange is
prevented at all points.&nbsp; There is no lure in the sunshine,
no siren voice in the gale.&nbsp; Summer rain does not call you
out into the open, to share the joy of it with the drinking grass
and leaves.&nbsp; Amidst your dead, impenetrable
bricks-and-mortar, you can plod on with your scribbling or
figuring without a heart-stir; no vine-leaf will tap at <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>your window,
no lily-of-the-field taunt your industry, nor song of skylark
dissipate your dreams.</p>
<p>But indoor work, carried on in a village deep in the green
heart of some beautiful country-side, is on an entirely different
plane.&nbsp; At times, perhaps, it becomes the hardest work in
the world.&nbsp; With one lavish hand life gives you the things
most necessary for close, unremitting application, and with the
other she ruthlessly sets all manner of obstacles in your
path.&nbsp; On such a day as now dawned crystal-clear over
Windlecombe, with the first warm wind of the year blowing new
life into everything, there was no stopping indoors for me.&nbsp;
I got down to my work punctually enough, even a little before the
wonted time.&nbsp; But good resolutions could make no headway
against such odds.&nbsp; The south-west wind boomed merrily in
the elm-tops.&nbsp; The sunbeams riddled my old house through and
through.&nbsp; Out in the garden robins and thrushes had formed
themselves into a grand orchestra; and when the breeze lulled for
a moment, I could hear the larks singing far overhead, as though
it were a summer&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; An hour of half-hearted
tinkering saw my fortitude break like a milldam.&nbsp; Five
minutes later I had shut the house-door behind me, and was off up
the village street, gulping down deep draughts of the sweet
morning air.</p>
<p>I chose the path that led to the Downs.&nbsp; <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Mounting the
steep, chalky track in the arms of the gale, with the misty green
heights looming up before me against the blue of the
winter&rsquo;s morning, one fact was borne in upon me at every
step.&nbsp; Though I must needs write winter&mdash;for January
was but three parts done&mdash;it was no longer winter, but
spring.&nbsp; A few days&rsquo; sunny warmth had worked what
seemed like a miracle.&nbsp; In the hedges and trees the buds
were swelling.&nbsp; Birds were pairing.&nbsp; Young green spears
of grass showed underfoot.&nbsp; Across the path clouds of midges
danced in the sunshine.&nbsp; I heard the first low love-croon of
a wood-dove; and, when I stopped for breath in the lee of the
hazel-copse, there drifted out upon me a song never yet heard on
winter days&mdash;the mellow voice of a blackbird calling for a
mate.</p>
<p>But the more we study Nature out of doors, the more we come to
disbelieve in winter altogether.&nbsp; Winter is in truth a
myth.&nbsp; From the moment the old year&rsquo;s leaves are down,
the earth is in vigorous preparation for the new year&rsquo;s
life and growth.&nbsp; Nature lies by quietly enough during the
cold spells, but each awakening is a stronger and more joyous
one.&nbsp; While they last, the long frosts seem to hold all the
life of things suspended.&nbsp; Yet, with every return of the
south-west wind, it is easy to see that this is not really
so.&nbsp; Though the visible sunbeams have had no power <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>for progress,
those stored in the earth have been slowly and steadily at
work.&nbsp; And when the thaw comes, Nature seems to take up the
slack of the year in one tremendous forward pull.</p>
<p>I reached the crest of Windle Down, and made over the springy,
dew-soaked grass, content to go wheresoever the tearing wind
should drive me.&nbsp; The long, billowing curves of the hills
stretched away on all sides until they lost themselves in distant
violet haze.&nbsp; Here and there flocks of sheep made a grey
patch in the sunlit solitude, and a low clamour of bells was in
the air blent with the unending song of the larks.&nbsp; On the
combe-sides the gorse spread its darker green, and, near at hand,
I could make out its gold buds already bursting under the touch
of the sunbeams The next hill before me was topped with a ring of
fencing, near which stood a solitary figure, clear cut against
the tender blue of the north.</p>
<p>Shepherding on the South Downs is an hereditary family
calling, and old George Artlett, the shepherd at Windlecombe
farm, had trained up two at least of his four sons to follow in
his own tranquil steps.&nbsp; In village life, though the essence
of neighbourliness is that it must be exercised impartially to
one and all, worthy or unworthy, there are ever some about you
with whom the daily traffic of genial word and deed comes more <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>aptly than
with the rest.&nbsp; In all the years I had known the Artletts,
there had been scarce a day when I had not encountered one or
other of that sturdy clan, and generally to my profit.&nbsp; If
it was not the old shepherd himself placidly trailing along in
the rear of his flock with his shining crook, it was
&lsquo;young&rsquo; George, the fifty-year-old under-shepherd,
his pocket bulged out with a Bible; or Dewie, the
shepherd&rsquo;s boy; or John, the sporting handy-man, tramping
off to covert with his pack of mongrels; or quaint
&lsquo;Mistus&rsquo; Artlett, carrying her household basket to
and from the shop.&nbsp; Of Tom Artlett&mdash;the &lsquo;Singing
Ploughman,&rsquo; as he was called in the neighbouring market
town&mdash;I got a glimpse sometimes in the early grey of
morning, or more often of late afternoon, as he journeyed between
home and farm.&nbsp; He ploughed his acre a day conscientiously,
walking the usual twelve miles in the doing of it; and all the
while his rich, powerful voice made the hills about him echo with
the songs he loved.</p>
<p>Why he sang these songs, and why young George&rsquo;s pocket
always bulged, would have been at once evident to you if you
could have looked out of window with me any Sunday morning about
eight of the clock.&nbsp; Punctually at that hour, the two
brothers strode by in their scarlet guernseys and blue, braided
coats, on their way <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>to the town; and there they passed a seventh day more
toilsome than all the other six, coming home at nightfall hoarse
and weary, yet plainly as happy as any men could be.</p>
<p>Young George Artlett stood on the hill-top, leaning upon his
crook.&nbsp; The wind fluttered his coat about him, and lashed
his haversack to and fro.&nbsp; He stood with his back in my
direction, bare-headed, his grey hair streaming in the
breeze.&nbsp; It was not until I had almost come up with him that
I marked his uplifted face, his closed eyes, his moving lips; and
then I stopped irresolutely, ashamed of the blunder I had
committed.&nbsp; But before I could turn and retreat, the dog at
his side had signalled my presence.&nbsp; The old tarpaulin
sou&rsquo;wester hat was returned to its place.&nbsp; Young
George wheeled round, and looked at me with eyes of welcome.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knowed by th&rsquo; bark o&rsquo; him, who
&rsquo;twur,&rsquo; he said, in his slow, deep, quiet
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rowster, &rsquo;a has a name fer all o&rsquo;
ye.&nbsp; That there little happy shruck, &rsquo;tis yerself
an&rsquo; nane other.&nbsp; When &rsquo;a perks up an&rsquo;
bellers, &rsquo;tis th&rsquo; poodle-dorg an&rsquo; Miss
Sweet.&nbsp; An&rsquo; when &rsquo;a grizzles, I an&rsquo;t no
call to look around; there be a black coat no gurt ways off, sure
as big apples comes from little uns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He smiled to himself, as though the memory of some recent
encounter with the black coat had <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>returned to him.&nbsp; Then he took a
quick glance at the sun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Drinkin&rsquo;-time!&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>His sheep were all on the far hill-side, half a mile off
perhaps, feeding&mdash;as sheep always do on windy
days&mdash;with their heads to the breeze; and shouldering
together in long, straight lines, roughly parallel&mdash;as,
again, sheep generally will, in spite of the prettily ordered
groups on painters&rsquo; canvases.&nbsp; It is only on days of
perfect calm that grazing sheep will head to all points of the
compass, and on the South Downs such days are rare indeed.</p>
<p>George Artlett put his hands to his mouth funnel-wise, and
sent the shepherd&rsquo;s folding-call ringing on the breeze.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Coo-oo-oo-o-up!&nbsp; Coo-oo-oo-o-up!&nbsp; Coom
along&mdash;coo-oo-up!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The shrill, wild notes pealed out, drawing an echo from every
hill far and near.&nbsp; At once all the ewes on the distant
sunny slope stopped their nibbling, and looked round.&nbsp; Again
the cry rang forth.&nbsp; This time the foremost sheep moved a
step or two in our direction, hesitated, then came slowly
on.&nbsp; A moment later the whole flock was under way, pouring
steadily up the hill-side and filling the air with a deep,
clamorous song.</p>
<p>But two or three of the younger sheep had stayed behind in a
little bay of grass beyond the <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>furze-brake.&nbsp; Rowster looked
inquiringly at his master, got a consenting wave of the arm, and
was off with the speed of light.&nbsp; We watched him as he raced
down the hill in a wide semicircle, and, taking the malingerers
in the rear, drove them helter-skelter after the rest.&nbsp;
Yelping and snapping behind them, he brought the whole flock up
to the dew-pond at what seemed an entirely unnecessary pace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis allers so wi&rsquo; dorgs,&rsquo; observed
young George reflectively.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ye can never larn them as
shepherd work ought to go slow as the sun i&rsquo; the sky.&nbsp;
All fer hurry an&rsquo; bustle they be, from birth-time to
buryin&rsquo;&mdash;get the hour by, sez they, the day over, life
done, an&rsquo; on wi&rsquo; the next thing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>We turned our shoulders to the blustering wind, and leant over
the rail together, watching the sheep drink.&nbsp; These
dew-ponds on the Sussex Downs are always a mystery to strangers
coming for the first time into the sheep country; and they are
never quite bereft of their miraculous quality, even among the
shepherds themselves.&nbsp; That in a land, where there are
neither springs nor natural pools of water, man should dig
hollows, not in the lowest sink-points of the valleys where one
would reasonably make such a work, but on the summits of the
highest hills, and then confidently expect Nature to fill them
with water, keeping them so filled year after <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>year, in and
out of season, no matter what call was made on their
resources&mdash;must appear little else than downright ineptitude
to one who has never had the feasibility of the plan demonstrated
under his very eyes.&nbsp; Yet the seeming wonder of the dew-pond
has a very simple explanation.&nbsp; It is nothing more than a
cold spot on the earth, which continually precipitates the
moisture from the air passing over it; and this cold spot is
formed on the hill-top because there it encounters air which has
not been robbed of its vapour by previous contact with the
earth.</p>
<p>The best dew-pan makers are the men of Wiltshire, as all
flockmasters know.&nbsp; The pond, having been excavated to the
right depth and shape, is lined first with puddled clay or chalk,
then with a thick layer of dry straw; finally, upon this straw a
further substantial coating of clay is laid, and well beaten
down.&nbsp; Nothing is needed then but to bring a few cart-loads
of water to start the pond, and to set a ring-fence about it to
keep off heavy stock.&nbsp; The action of the straw, in its
waterproof double-casing, is to intercept the heat-radiation of
the earth at that particular point, so that the pond-cavity and
its contents remain colder than the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>How the dew-pond came to be invented has often been the
subject of wondering speculation.&nbsp; No doubt there have been
dew-pond makers for <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>untold centuries back, but at one time, however far
distant, a first discovery of the principle underlying the thing
must have been made.&nbsp; Probably the dew-pond, in some form or
other, had its origin in those remote times when all the
high-lying chalk-lands of southern England were overrun by a
dense population.&nbsp; But then, as now, the region must have
been waterless; and the people, living there for security&rsquo;s
sake, must, nevertheless, have been constrained to provide
themselves with this first daily necessity of all life.&nbsp; We
read of the manna given in the Wilderness, and the water struck
from the Rock.&nbsp; These were miracles worked, as miracles ever
are, for children: they were grown men, evidently, in mind and
heart, to whom the dew-pond was given.&nbsp; For though the
thing, in essence, was set to shine about their feet wherever men
trod, so that none could forbear seeing, its adaptation to human
need was left to man&rsquo;s own labour and thoughtful
ingenuity.&nbsp; To-day, as in those far-off ages, the dwarf
plume-thistle studs the sward of the Downs, each circle of thick,
fleshy leaves, matted together and centrally depressed, forming a
perfect little dew-pond, that retains its garnered moisture long
after all other vegetation has grown dry in the heat of the
mounting sun.&nbsp; Even if there were no such thing as a
dew-pond on all the Downs to-day, and every flock must perforce
be <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>driven
miles, perhaps, down into the valley to be watered, it is
inconceivable that no one of prime intelligence, wandering the
hills alive to the need of the thirsty thousands around him,
would mark the natural reservoirs of the thistles, reason out the
principles they embodied, and straightway set brain and hand to
work on the first dew-pond&mdash;using perchance, in earliest
experiment, the actual thistle-leaves for the indispensable
heat-retarding layer.</p>
<p>I had often talked the matter over with George Artlett, and
now we drifted into the old subject.&nbsp; But he was never to be
cajoled out of his belief in the miraculous nature of the
affair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Him as sent th&rsquo; fire down to th&rsquo; could
altar,&rsquo; he said, his long arm going up to heaven, and his
voice taking on that deep, vibratory chime so familiar to Sunday
loiterers in Stavisham marketplace, &lsquo;He knaws how to send
watter to faith an&rsquo; a dry pan.&nbsp; Ay! but I ha&rsquo;
seed it comin&rsquo;, many&rsquo;s the time.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
th&rsquo; first time, I &rsquo;lowed as &rsquo;twur High Barn
ricks burnin&rsquo;.&nbsp; We was goin&rsquo; hoame to fold, and
there afore me, right agen th&rsquo; red night-sky, I seed a gurt
topplin&rsquo; cloud o&rsquo; summut as looked like smoke ahent
th&rsquo; hill.&nbsp; Sez I, &rsquo;tis High Barn ricks
afire!&nbsp; But it warn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It wur jest Gorramighty
gatherin&rsquo; together His dew from the fower winds o&rsquo;
heaven, an&rsquo; pourin&rsquo; it into Maast&rsquo;
Coles&rsquo;s pond.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>III</h3>
<p>One afternoon, when the month was all but at its end, I came
home through the riverside meadows.&nbsp; The sun had just dipped
below the misty earth-line.&nbsp; Before me, in the east, the
darkness was spreading up the sky, and the larger stars already
shone with something of their nightly lustre.&nbsp; But behind me
it was still day.&nbsp; From the horizon upward, and far
overhead, the sky was a pale, luminous turquoise, overflecked
with cloud of fiery amber&mdash;the two colours a perfect harmony
of cold and heat.&nbsp; As I trod the narrow field-path, facing
the dusk, with all that glorious enmity reconciled at my back, I
became aware of a mysterious sound somewhere in the chain of
tree-girt meadows on ahead.&nbsp; A missel-thrush had been
singing hard by, but now his clarion had ceased, and this other
far-away note forced me suddenly out of my musing.&nbsp; It was
not a single song, but a deep, continuous outpouring, a medley of
music like the splashing and tumbling of mountain brooks.&nbsp;
With every step forward it grew in volume.&nbsp; At last, in a
belt of elm-trees that bordered one of the farthest fields, I
came upon the cause of it; and though I had many times seen vast
congregations of starlings, I had never before encountered so
huge a company as now met my gaze.</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>The
trees stretched across the entire field, and every twig on every
branch had its perching songster, the combined effect being as
though the trees had suddenly shot out a magic foliage,
coal-black against the deepening blue of the sky, heavy and thick
as leaves in June.&nbsp; Now the mountain brooks had swollen to
Niagaras.&nbsp; The hubbub was literally deafening.&nbsp; I
shouted my loudest, hoping to set the gargantuan host to flight,
but I could scarce hear my own voice.&nbsp; For a full ten
minutes I stood in that great flood-tide of melody, and all the
time fresh detachments of birds were continually arriving to
swell the multitude, and add their voices to the chorus.&nbsp; At
length I saw two birds break away from the mass, and fly straight
off side by side.&nbsp; Immediately the tumult ceased, and there
followed a sound like the long, rumbling roll of thunder.&nbsp;
The whole concourse had taken wing together, the tree-tops,
released from their weight, lashing back as though struck by a
flaw of wind.&nbsp; Now the army swept over my head, darkening
the sky as it went.&nbsp; The thunderous sound grew less and less
as the flock made for the distant woods.&nbsp; A moment more, and
an uncanny silence had fallen on everything.&nbsp; Then, half a
mile away in the misty dark, I heard the rich, wild voice peal
out again, where the starling host had taken up their quarters
for the night.</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Thus it
happened every evening for a week after, when they passed on out
of the district and I saw them no more.&nbsp; Probably no single
stretch of country could support such incredible numbers for more
than a few days together, and they must be for ever trekking
onward, leaving behind them a famine-stricken land, and making
life all the harder for our own native birds.&nbsp; For there is
little doubt that these vast hordes of starlings that sweep the
country-side in winter, are foreigners in the main.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> where my old house stands,
behind its double row of lindens at the top of the green, you can
see well-nigh all that is happening in Windlecombe.&nbsp; Sitting
at the writing-table in the great bay-window, you get an
uninterrupted view down the length of the village street.&nbsp;
From the windows right and left&mdash;through a trellis of bare
branches in winter, and, in summer, through gaps in the
greenery&mdash;you overlook the side-alleys where dwell the less
profoundly respectable, the more free-and-easy, of Windlecombe
folk.&nbsp; And in the rear, beyond my garden and little orchard,
there is the farm&mdash;rickyard and barn and dwelling-house all
crowded together on the green hill-side bestrewn with grazing
cattle, cocks and hens innumerable, all of the snow-white breed,
gobbling turkeys, and guinea-fowl that cry &lsquo;Come back, come
back!&rsquo; every waking moment of their lives.</p>
<p>All the oldest houses in Windlecombe are gathered round the
village green.&nbsp; Here, amidst <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>its thicket of live-oak and yew, the
church tower rears its bluff grey stones against the sky, its
clock-face with the one gilded hour-hand (minutes are of no
account in Windlecombe) turned to catch the last light of
evening.&nbsp; The parsonage, the village shop, the forge and
wheelwright&rsquo;s yard, a dozen or more of ivy-smothered
tenements, stand at easy intervals round the oblong of the
green.&nbsp; There is the little sweetstuff shop at the far
corner, side by side with the cobbler&rsquo;s den; and, beyond
them, the inn juts boldly out half across the roadway,
silhouetting its sign against the distant, bright patch of river
which flows at the foot of the hill.</p>
<p>I often wonder how other villages get on without a
green.&nbsp; In Windlecombe all the life of the place seems to
culminate here.&nbsp; On summer evenings every one drifts this
way at some time or other for a quiet stroll, or a chat with
friends on the seats under the &lsquo;Seven Sisters,&rsquo; a
group of gnarled Scotch pines almost in the centre of the
green.</p>

<p>Even in winter I seldom look forth and see it entirely
deserted.&nbsp; Except in school-hours, there are always children
playing upon it, and the old men, whose work in the fields is
done, hold here daily a sort of informal club whenever the sun
shines.&nbsp; But the old women I never see.&nbsp; All their
lives long, their activities and interests have been centred in
the home, and now they <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>spend the dusk of their days
consistently by the firesides.&nbsp; On week-days, the fairest
summer weather has no power to tempt them abroad.&nbsp; Up to
seventy or so, they can be seen creeping over the green towards
the church on Sunday mornings; but it is duty, not desire, that
has drawn them from their burrows.&nbsp; For the rest of the week
they sit, most of them, stitching tiny scraps of silk and cotton
together.&nbsp; It seems to be an indispensable condition of
future bliss with all the old women in Sussex, that each should
finish a patchwork quilt before she dies.</p>
<p>There comes a morning in the year, generally in early
February, when the fact that the days are getting longer is
suddenly driven in upon your consciousness, as though the change
had come about in a single night at the touch of some
magician&rsquo;s wand.</p>
<p>A long spell of gloomy weather ends in a crisp, bright
dawn.&nbsp; Through the chinks in the blind, the sun casts
quivering spots of gold upon the wall.&nbsp; You wake from your
dreams, and immediately know that life has become a different
thing from that of yesterday.&nbsp; Throwing the casements back,
there comes in upon you a flood of new light, new air, new
melody.&nbsp; It is barely eight o&rsquo;clock, and already the
sun is high over Windle hill.&nbsp; The thrushes have given up
their winter piping, and have begun to sing in the old <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>glad way,
linking half a dozen sweet notes in a phrase together, and
pouring it out over and over again.&nbsp; The air has the savour
of warm earth in it, the scent of green growth; and, looking down
at the flower-borders in the garden, you see sheaves of snowdrops
breaking up through the soil, and the first crocuses yielding
their treasure to the first bees.</p>
<p>To-day, though it was only the first of February, just such
another morning startled me from sleep, and sent me out of doors
tingling to the finger-tips with this new spirit of wonder at a
changed order of things.&nbsp; Over Windlecombe, in the level
sunlight, half a hundred violet plumes of smoke rose into the
calm air.&nbsp; From the smithy came the steady chime of Tom
Clemmer&rsquo;s anvil.&nbsp; The pit-saw was droning in the
wheelwright&rsquo;s yard.&nbsp; Up at High Barn they were
threshing wheat, and the sound might have been that from a great
cathedral organ, so far off that nothing but the deep tones of
the pedal-pipes could reach the ear.&nbsp; But though all these
sounds denoted humanity astir, and busy at the day&rsquo;s task,
to the eye there was no sign of any one abroad.&nbsp; I was as
much alone as Crusoe on his island, and just as free to wander
where I would.</p>
<p>I skirted the green, and turned in at the churchyard
gate.&nbsp; Everywhere between the crowding <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>stones, the
grass was white with dew.&nbsp; Glittering water-bells rimmed
every leaf, and trembled at the tip of every twig.&nbsp; The old
yew dripped solemnly in its shadowed corner.&nbsp; Down the face
of each memorial-stone, tiny runnels coursed like tears.</p>
<p>It was strange to see how the dewdrops obliterated all vestige
of natural colour in the grass, and yet lent it a thousand alien
hues.&nbsp; As I moved slowly along, sparks of vivid green and
crimson, orange and blue, flashed incessantly amidst the frosted
silver.&nbsp; Turning my back to the sunshine, all these colours
vanished, and the glittering quality of the dew was lost.&nbsp;
Now it was just a dead-white field, crossed and re-crossed with
lines of emerald where the foraging birds had left their
tracks.&nbsp; But all round the head of my shadow, that stretched
giant-like before me, there was still a shining circle of
light.&nbsp; I remembered to have read somewhere of one of the
religious painters in the Middle Age, who accounted himself
divinely set apart from his fellows, by reason of a halo which,
he said, appeared at certain seasons about him as he walked in
the fields.&nbsp; Probably he saw then what I saw this morning;
but, being an artist, he won inspiration, new freshets of saintly
energy, from what, to the ordinary unemotional sinner, would be
no more than an interesting, natural fact.</p>
<h3><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>II</h3>
<p>Towards afternoon, quite a little throng of ancient folk
gathered on the benches under the Seven Sisters, drawn thither by
the sunny mildness of the day.&nbsp; Sauntering about on the
green hard by, I could hear the low hum of their voices; and at
last I took a place, almost unobserved, on one of the outer seats
a little distance from the group.</p>
<p>Eavesdropping, even in its most innocent form, hardly comes
into the category of virtues; but, in any serious attempt to
study country life and character, it must be reckoned almost a
necessary vice.&nbsp; I confess, in this respect, not only to
having yielded to it as a lifelong, irresistible habit, but to
having cultivated it on many occasions as an art.&nbsp; The
English peasant under open observation is no more himself than a
wild bird in a cage; and these old folk, in particular, needed as
much wary stalking-down as any creature of the woodland.&nbsp;
Settled myself quietly now behind a newspaper in the corner, my
presence, if it had been marked at all, was soon forgotten; and
the talk began again among the group in the usual desultory,
pondering style&mdash;talk in the ancient dialect of Sussex, such
as you will hear to-day only in the most out-of-the-way villages,
and <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>then
only among those with whose passing it also must pass irrevocably
away.</p>
<p>Daniel Dray, the old wheelwright, was tapping his stick
reflectively on his boot-toe, keeping time with the song of the
pit-saw in the neighbouring yard, where young Daniel was mightily
at work.&nbsp; By his side sat Tom Clemmer the elder, his bleak
grey eyes far away in space.&nbsp; All the rest of the company
were studying the horizon in much the same distraught, silent
fashion.&nbsp; A very old, but still hearty man, in a wide blue
suit, was chipping at a plug of sailor&rsquo;s tobacco with a
jack-knife, and smiling to himself.&nbsp; At length the smile
developed into a rich chuckle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dan&rsquo;l,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;now you ha&rsquo;
spoke a trew wured, if never afore!&nbsp; So they be,
Dan&rsquo;l, so they be!&nbsp; Ay! an&rsquo; all round the wureld
&rsquo;tis th&rsquo; same wi&rsquo; &rsquo;em!&nbsp; Doan&rsquo;t
I know?&rsquo;&nbsp; He made a telling pause at the question, and
then&mdash;&lsquo;Not &rsquo;aaf!&rsquo; he added in solemn
irony, as he struck a match on his hindermost serge.</p>
<p>The old wheelwright stretched himself luxuriously in the
sunshine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knows naun o&rsquo; Frenchies, an&rsquo; blackamoors,
an&rsquo; sech-like,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;But a Sussex
maid!&mdash;Ah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The exclamation, long drawn out, was echoed round the
circle.&nbsp; Old Tom Clemmer turned argumentatively in his
seat.</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>&lsquo;Ay! real purty, Dan&rsquo;l!&mdash;purty
enough!&rsquo; he agreed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ye wur i&rsquo;
luck&rsquo;s way, as I minds well wur said by all th&rsquo; folk,
forebye &rsquo;tis so long ago.&nbsp; But, Fegs! man!&nbsp; We
han&rsquo;t all had your fortun&rsquo; i&rsquo; bright
eyes!&nbsp; What sez Maast&rsquo; Grimble there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A thin high voice quavered out from the end of the
bench.&nbsp; For full five minutes it hovered in mid-air, like a
long-drawn-out treble note on a violin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay! trew, Tom!&nbsp; Never a wured o&rsquo; a lee,
Tom!&nbsp; But &rsquo;twur nane o&rsquo; my doin&rsquo;, as
many&rsquo;s th&rsquo; time I ha&rsquo; tould ye.&nbsp; Stavisham
Fair, &rsquo;twur, i&rsquo; Fifty-three, as I first seed her, all
i&rsquo; sky-blew an&rsquo; spangles; wi&rsquo; th&rsquo; lights
flarin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; th&rsquo; drooms bustin&rsquo;,
an&rsquo; th&rsquo; trumpets blowin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; sech a
crowd o&rsquo; gay folk as never got together afore, i&rsquo;
th&rsquo; wureld.&nbsp; Wunk, &rsquo;a did, at me; an&rsquo; I
wunk back.&nbsp; Then &rsquo;a wunk agen, an&rsquo; &rsquo;twur
all ower, neighbours!&nbsp; We got church-bawled th&rsquo;
follerin&rsquo; Sunday; an&rsquo; hoame I fetched her all within
th&rsquo; month.&nbsp; An&rsquo; then, Tom, ye knowed how&rsquo;t
fell out.&nbsp; Six weeks o&rsquo; it, we had together; an&rsquo;
then off &rsquo;a goos after &rsquo;a&rsquo;s ould carrawan agen,
an&rsquo; I goos fer a souldger.&nbsp; An&rsquo; nane but
th&rsquo; gurt goodness knows whether I be married man or
widder-man to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The faint, shrill voice ceased.&nbsp; A lean, old man, with a
chubby face and eyes of so pale a blue, that they seemed almost
colourless in the rich, <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>yellow light of the afternoon, had
been intently listening, a trembling hand to each ear.&nbsp; He
wore a spotless white round-frock, and was punctiliously,
unnaturally clean in all other respects.&nbsp; Now he brought his
finger-tips softly together, and stared at the sky in an ecstasy
of reminiscence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eighteen thousand happy days,&rsquo; said he
triumphantly, &lsquo;agen six weeks o&rsquo; rough an&rsquo;
tumble&mdash;pore George!&nbsp; Ah! well-a-day!&nbsp; But
&rsquo;tis so, neighbours.&nbsp; Th&rsquo; Reverend, &rsquo;a
figured it out fer Jane an&rsquo; me laast catterning-time.&nbsp;
Eighteen thou&mdash;&nbsp; Gorm! but I should ha&rsquo; lost
&rsquo;em all, if she hadn&rsquo;t up an&rsquo; spoke out!&nbsp;
I ne&rsquo;er had no thought on&rsquo;t, trew as th&rsquo; sun
goos round th&rsquo; sky.&nbsp; But Jane, &rsquo;a gie me a red
neckercher wan Hock-Monday.&nbsp; Thinks I, &ldquo;Wat&rsquo;s
that fer?&rdquo;&nbsp; An&rsquo; then &rsquo;a gie me a bag
o&rsquo; pea-nuts, an&rsquo; sez I to mysel&rsquo;,
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a queer maid surelye!&rdquo;&nbsp; An&rsquo;
then &rsquo;a cooms along at harvest-time, an&rsquo; sez she,
&ldquo;&rsquo;Enery Dawes, I ha&rsquo; jist heerd as ould Mistus
Fenny &rsquo;ull gie up th&rsquo; malthouse cottage at Milemas,
an&rsquo; seein&rsquo; as how you warnts me an&rsquo; I warnts
you, &rsquo;twould be a pity to lose it; so let&rsquo;s get
arsted i&rsquo; church directly-minute,&rdquo; sez she.&nbsp;
Wi&rsquo; that, &rsquo;a putt both arms around th&rsquo; red
neckercher, as I wore; an&rsquo; gie me wan, two,
three&mdash;each chop, an&rsquo; wan i&rsquo; th&rsquo;
middle.&nbsp; Lor&rsquo; bless ye!&nbsp; I knowed then what
&rsquo;a meant, I did!&nbsp; I wur allers <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>th&rsquo;
sort as could see through a brick wall fur as most folk: never
warnted no more &rsquo;n an &rsquo;int.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There agen!&rsquo; said old Tom Clemmer, after a
pause.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ye wur another o&rsquo; th&rsquo; lucky wans,
&rsquo;Enery.&nbsp; Th&rsquo; best o&rsquo; wimmin plunked
straight into your eye, in a manner o&rsquo;
speakin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Ah! but courtin&rsquo; days warn&rsquo;t
all pea-nuts an&rsquo; red handkerchers wi&rsquo; some o&rsquo;
us, &rsquo;Enery!&nbsp; Dear! oh Lor&rsquo;! what trouble I did
ha&rsquo;, surelye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, and sat for a while smiling down into the bowl of
his pipe, and shaking his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But ye got her at laast, Tom!&rsquo; said Daniel Dray
softly.&nbsp; He stole a commiserate glance round at the other
members of the company, and had a silent, meaning nod from
each.&nbsp; Old Tom Clemmer blushed, then laughed outright.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trew, Dan&rsquo;l!&nbsp; An&rsquo; well I reckermembers
th&rsquo; day as &rsquo;a first come to Windlecombe&mdash;up to
th&rsquo; farm-us yonder, though &rsquo;tis forty year ago.&nbsp;
All o&rsquo; a heap, I wur, soon as I sot eyes on her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Churn-maid?&rdquo; sez I to mysel&rsquo;,
&ldquo;&rsquo;twunt be long afore y&rsquo;are summut
better&rsquo;n that, down at th&rsquo; forge-cottage &rsquo;long
o&rsquo; me!&rdquo;&nbsp; Come Sunday, I runs agen her on
th&rsquo; litten-path.&nbsp; &ldquo;Marnin&rsquo;, Mary!&rdquo;
sez I, an&rsquo; gies her th&rsquo; marigolds I&rsquo;d picked
fer her out o&rsquo; my own gay-ground; an&rsquo; down &rsquo;a
throws &rsquo;em in th&rsquo; mud, an&rsquo; off wi&rsquo;out so
much as wured or look.&nbsp; Ah! a proud, fine maid &rsquo;a
wur!&mdash;to be sure an&rsquo; all!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Tom
Clemmer knocked out his pipe upon his crutch.&nbsp; Then he threw
an exultant glance about him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What might a man do then, ye&rsquo;d think?&nbsp; Well,
as marigolds warn&rsquo;t no good, I tries laylocks.&nbsp; Not a
bit on it!&nbsp; Jerrineums&mdash;wuss an&rsquo; wuss!&nbsp;
Roses&mdash;never so much as a sniff!&nbsp; Summut useful, thinks
I; but they little spring onions as I tied up in a bunch
wi&rsquo; yaller ribbin, an&rsquo; hung on th&rsquo; dairy gate
fer her, there they hung &rsquo;til they was yaller too.&nbsp;
Then I has a grand idee.&nbsp; Off I goos to Stavisham, an&rsquo;
buys a gurt big hamber brooch; an&rsquo; a silver necklace wot
weighed down my pocket, carryin&rsquo; of it; an&rsquo; a
spanglorious goulden weddin&rsquo;-ring.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, my
gel, we&rsquo;ll jest see!&rdquo; sez I all th&rsquo; way
hoame.&nbsp; I bides quiet &rsquo;til Sunday, then I hides ahent
th&rsquo; gurt elver-tree, an&rsquo; pops out upon her
suddentlike, as &rsquo;a cooms along.&nbsp; I offers her
th&rsquo; brooch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get out o&rsquo; my way!&rdquo;
sez she, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis jest a common ha&rsquo;penny
fairin&rsquo;&mdash;&nbsp; No, &rsquo;tis hamber, &rsquo;tis real
purty!&rdquo; &rsquo;a sez, an&rsquo; brings up
stock-still.&nbsp; Then out cooms th&rsquo; necklace, an&rsquo;
down went &rsquo;a&rsquo;s good book slap i&rsquo; th&rsquo;
dirt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! &rsquo;tis kind o&rsquo; ye,
blacksmith!&rdquo; sez she, ketchin&rsquo; hould
on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! but what thinks you o&rsquo; this
here?&rdquo; sez I; &ldquo;but I mount gie it ye yet awhile,
&rsquo;cause &rsquo;tis unlucky fer a maid to ha&rsquo; th&rsquo;
ring afore th&rsquo; day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lor! what eyes &rsquo;a
had, surelye!&nbsp; &rsquo;A thought a <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>bit, then sez she, &ldquo;Thomas
Clemmer, how much ha&rsquo; ye got laid by?&rdquo;&nbsp;
An&rsquo; soon as I&rsquo;d tould her, sez she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
ha&rsquo; ye, Tom, darlin&rsquo;, fer I never loved nane but
you!&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah! well, well!&nbsp; Most onaccountable,
&rsquo;tis, how th&rsquo; very wureds cooms back to ye, arter
years an&rsquo; years!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He fell into a brown study, out of which he presently came
with a jerk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fower o&rsquo;clock?&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; Gorm! how high
th&rsquo; sun be!&nbsp; I must be getten hoame-along!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He rose upon his one serviceable foot, fitted the other foot,
a shapeless bundle of linen, into the sling that hung from his
neck, seized his crutches, and stumped placidly away.&nbsp; There
was a direct path from the Seven Sisters across the green to Tom
Clemmer&rsquo;s cottage, but he always came and went by the
roundabout route through the churchyard.&nbsp; For the excellent,
but frugal-minded Mrs. Clemmer had lain there, under a home-made
iron cross and a carefully tended bed of marigolds, these twenty
years back.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Living year after year in Windlecombe, I have come by old
habit to associate with each month that passes its own
characteristic changes and events.&nbsp; February always stands
in my mind for three great ebullitions of the year&rsquo;s life,
<a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>equally
wonderful in their several ways&mdash;the coming of the elm
blossom, the earliest clamorous music from the lambing-pens, and
the first rich song of the awakening bees.</p>
<p>Through my study window, all this week of warm, glittering,
showery weather, I have watched the elm-trees about the
churchyard gradually lose their sharp, clear-cut outline of
winter, and dissolve into the misty softness of spring.&nbsp;
Already the tree-tops are so dense that the blue sky can barely
penetrate them.&nbsp; This change is not caused by the expanding
leaf buds, but by the opening of the myriad blossoms, which come
and go before the leaf.&nbsp; Their colour is a magnificent,
sombre purple; and the whole tree stands up in the sunshine, clad
in this gorgeous raiment from its bole to its highest
twig&mdash;an imperial garment reminding you in more ways than
one of ancient Rome and its C&aelig;sars; for there is little
doubt that the elm is no British tree, but was brought to us by
the Romans, all those centuries ago, with so many other good
things.</p>
<p>In the deep pockets of rich soil which have sifted down to the
valleys, and in the shallower soil of our chalk hills, almost
every species of forest tree makes generous growth.&nbsp; But
perhaps nothing takes so kindly to highland Sussex conditions as
the elm.&nbsp; The village gardens are fringed about with its
beautiful, wide-spreading <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>shapes, and, in summer, griddled over
with its long blue shadows.&nbsp; But no tree stands within a
distance of its own height from any dwelling.&nbsp; Hard
experience has taught men that the elm is undesirable as a near
neighbour.&nbsp; Of all trees it is the most comely, because it
is never symmetrical, but it owes this picturesque trait to a
habit intolerable in a close acquaintance.&nbsp; Not only does
the elm cast its great branches to earth at all times and without
creak or groan of warning, but during the season of the
equinoctial gales, you never know when the whole tree may not
come toppling over in a moment, measuring its vast length on the
ground with a sound like the impact of the heaviest wave that
ever thundered against Beachy Head.</p>
<p>It was so that the King of Windlecombe, the oldest and
mightiest elm through half the county, came down one pitch-black,
tempestuous night in a September of long ago.&nbsp; None of the
children, nor many of the younger folk in the village, now
remember the King, where he towered up beyond the east wall of
the churchyard, and every sunset threw his vast shadow half way
up the combe.&nbsp; But they are all familiar with the story of
his downfall.&nbsp; A wild night it was.&nbsp; Every window shook
in its frame; every chimney was an organ-pipe for the
wind&rsquo;s blowing; the sound of the rain on roof and wall was
like an incessant hail of <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>musketry.&nbsp; Thatches were
stripped off.&nbsp; The inn-sign went clattering down the
street.&nbsp; The gilt weather-cock on the church tower took a
list that it has kept to this day.&nbsp; No one dared go abroad
that night, but families sat close at home, keeping shoulder to
shoulder in timorous company, and dreadfully wondering what it
was like at sea.&nbsp; Had you need to speak, you must shout your
words, so great was the din of the hurricane.&nbsp; All night it
raged undiminished, and no one slept; some even would not venture
to bed, not knowing but the roof might be plucked off any moment
as they lay, and let the drenching torrent in upon them.&nbsp;
Then, as the first grey tinge of dawn blanched in the eastern
sky, high above the voice of the storm came one tremendous
booming note, as though the earth had split asunder.&nbsp; And
with the light, people looked out and saw that the King of
Windlecombe was down.</p>
<p>To-day, as I settled myself to work with the lattices tight
closed, to shut out the lure of the songful morning, there came a
patter of earth upon the glass.&nbsp; At first I thought it was
one of the martins&rsquo; nests broken away from the eaves above,
being stuffed too full of hay by interloping sparrows.&nbsp; But
the sharp volley sounded again, and looking out, there on the
path below I beheld the old vicar in wide-brimmed hat and tartan
shawl.</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>&lsquo;How now, old mole!&rsquo; cried he, shaking his
stout oak cudgel at me.&nbsp; &lsquo;The sun shines, the west
wind calls, all the brooks are laughing over their beds!&nbsp;
Yet there you hide in your burrow, grouting among dead words,
warming up stale, cold dreams a twelvemonth old!&nbsp; Shame on
you!&nbsp; Come out, and let the air and sunbeams riddle your
dusty fur!&nbsp; Come and lend me your eyes for a long
morning.&nbsp; I have seen to Mrs. Dawes&rsquo; rheumatics.&nbsp;
I have done the school.&nbsp; Old Collup has had his bedside
talk.&nbsp; I am free for a ramble, and I want to go everywhere
and hear tell of everything.&nbsp; Come this moment, or
I&rsquo;ll huff and I&rsquo;ll puff, and I&rsquo;ll blow your
house down!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With his jolly, wrinkled face turned upward, his long white
beard wagging, and his kind eyes steadily meeting mine, it was
difficult to believe that he could see only the faintest shadow
of all before him; that for years past he had lived and worked in
a world of deepest dusk, wherein the very noontide sun of summer
was no more than a pale spot in never-ending gloom.&nbsp; I got
my thick boots, and was soon trudging down the hill with him
towards the riverside woods and meadows, every yard of which had
been familiar to him in his days of light.</p>
<p>Arun was running high, with three spring tides yet to
come.&nbsp; Much rain had fallen of late.&nbsp; It <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>looked as
though the floods would soon be upon us, unless the wind changed,
and drier, colder weather set in.&nbsp; We skirted the
river-bank, with the wind whipping light ripples almost to our
feet, and the sun making a broad path of gold along the
waters.&nbsp; Beyond the river stretched level green pastures
intersected by deep dykes, and beyond these again lay the misty
blue sierra of wooded hills.&nbsp; The old parson strode easily
forward, his face turned up to the sky.&nbsp; His step never
faltered, but his stick hovered incessantly about the path as he
went.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hark to the wind in the trees!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That is a new voice: the elms must be in full bloom, and I
can guess what they look like.&nbsp; And the sound is different
in that clump of beeches there: the leaf-buds must be getting
long and green now.&nbsp; Only the ash and the oak keep their
winter voice in February.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus it always was on our walks together.&nbsp; What he heard,
he told me of; and what I saw, I gave him as well as I was
able.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Listen!&rsquo; he said presently.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you
hear that?&nbsp; That is the first chaffinch-song of the
year.&nbsp; And there is the great-tit clashing his silver
cymbals together, and the bullfinches blowing over the tops of
their latchkeys, and a green woodpecker laughing&mdash;he never
laughs in that grim, scornful way until the year is well on the
wing!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Then I,
not to be behind him:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see grass&mdash;fresh new growth pushing up
everywhere.&nbsp; Young nettles too: they are coming up green
amongst the old dead stems.&nbsp; But they cannot sting
yet&mdash;yes, they can! and badly!&nbsp; Stop here a moment,
Reverend!&nbsp; The celandines are out thick on the
bank&mdash;you remember their shining, yellow, five-rayed stars,
set in dark green leaves like the spade-blades of Hamlet&rsquo;s
diggers.&nbsp; Below on the bank, where it is too steep for
anything else to grow, there are coltsfoot flowers.&nbsp; The
drab earth glows with them&mdash;no leaves at all, but just long,
curved, scaly stems, each ending in a tuft of golden
fleece.&nbsp; And then there is&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know, I know!&nbsp; I can look back a dozen springs,
and see them all as well as you.&nbsp; But listen to that
thrush!&nbsp; That is his honeymooning note, and the pair must be
nesting not far away.&nbsp; I have found thrushes&rsquo; nests in
February many a time.&nbsp; See if you can find this
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your singer has flown.&nbsp; And there goes the hen,
out of the other side of the bush; if the nest is anywhere, it
will be here under this tangle of clematis.&nbsp; Yes, two eggs
already!&nbsp; I wish you could see their clear greenish-blue,
with the dapple-marks on it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I guided his hand to the nest, and his fingers wandered
lightly over it.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>&lsquo;Cold!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;She will not
begin to sit yet.&nbsp; Perhaps never on this clutch.&nbsp; There
is frost and snow ahead of us still, though all of us forget it
this weather, bird, beast, and man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The path led us into the hazelwood; hazel below, and overhead
soaring columns of beech, whose branches touched finger-tips
everywhere across the white-flecked blue of the sky.&nbsp; As we
went along, the sound of our footsteps in the fallen leaves was
like the sound of wading through water.&nbsp; I must read off to
him what I saw about me as though it were from a book.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The hazel-catkins were never so fine, I think, as they
are this spring.&nbsp; The wood is full of them, like showers of
gold-green rain falling.&nbsp; Whenever we brush against them,
clouds of pollen drift off in the wind.&nbsp; It is the wind that
makes the hazel-nuts which we gather by and by.&nbsp; What
millions upon millions of spores only to make a few bushels of
nuts!&nbsp; I struck a single bush with my stick just now, and,
for yards ahead, the sunshine was misty with the floating green
dust.&nbsp; Then, here and there on every
branch&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&nbsp; I can see it all!&nbsp; There are little
green buds each with a torch of bright crimson at its tip,
flaming in the sun.&nbsp; Why should they be so vividly coloured,
if only to catch what the wind brings&mdash;floating pollen as
blind as I?&nbsp; No, no!&nbsp; The hazel-nut was made for the
bees <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>originally, depend upon it.&nbsp; Nature never uses
bright colour unless to attract winged life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We came out of the wood on the south side.&nbsp; Stopping just
within the shade of the last trees, we had a view over a chain of
sunny, sheltered meadows that lay between the riverside willows
and the first steep escarpment of the Downs.&nbsp; Here the wind
was only a song above our heads.&nbsp; Scarce a breath stirred
where we leaned upon the gate in the sunshine.&nbsp; I must be at
my living book again, yet knew not where to begin, so crowded was
the page.</p>
<p>&lsquo;March is still three weeks off, and yet the hares are
already as mad as can be.&nbsp; Over there under the Hanger, a
mile away, I can see them racing and tumbling about
together.&nbsp; There are more celandines and coltsfoot blossom
everywhere.&nbsp; I can see daisies wherever I look, and there is
a disc of dandelion by the gate-post just where you stand.&nbsp;
What clouds of midges!&nbsp; Thousands are dancing in the air
above our heads, and I can see their wings making a hazy streak
of light all down the hedgerow, where the elders are in
flourishing green leaf.&nbsp; Did you ever hear so many birds all
singing at the same time?&nbsp; And there goes an army of rooks
and jackdaws overhead!&nbsp; What a din!&mdash;the high, yelping
treble of the daws, and the deep-voiced rooks singing bass to
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>The
Reverend put a hand upon my arm to stop me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can hear something else,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A dandelion, did you say?&nbsp; Then she will come
straight for it.&rsquo;&nbsp; And as he spoke, I heard the old
familiar sound too.&nbsp; It was a hive-bee, tempted abroad by
the glad spring sunlight.&nbsp; She came straight over the
meadows.&nbsp; Passing all other blossoms by, she settled on the
single flower half-hidden in its whorl of ragged green leaves
close beside us, and forthwith began to smother herself in its
yellow pollen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And there she goes again!&rsquo; said the old vicar, as
the soft, rich sound mingled once more with the myriad other
notes about us.&nbsp; &lsquo;High up into the
air&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t she?&mdash;making ever a wider and wider
circle until she gets her first flying-mark, and then in the
usual zigzag course, home to the hive!&nbsp; A bee-line!&nbsp;
People always make the words stand for something absolutely
straight and direct.&nbsp; But a true bee-line is the easiest way
between two points, not necessarily the shortest.&nbsp; To take a
bee-line, if folk only knew it, is just to fly through the
calmest, or most favouring airs, judge the quickest way between
all obstacles, dodge the ravenous tits and sparrows, and so get
home safe and sound to the hive.&rsquo;</p>

48</span>IV</h3>
<p>This spring, the Artletts have built their lambing-pens on the
sunny slope of Windle Hill in full view of the village.&nbsp;
When, at threshing-time last autumn, the waggons toiled up the
steep hillside with their shuddering loads of yellow straw, and
the ricks were fashioned end to end in a curving line against the
north, strangers wondered why a farmer should carry his
bedding-down material so far from its main centres of
consumption, the stables and cowsheds.&nbsp; But the reason for
the work is clear enough at last.&nbsp; Behind the solid rampart
of straw, the lambing-pens lie in cosy shelter, and every day now
sees them more populous; day and night, as the month wends on,
there arises from them a fuller and fuller melody.</p>
<p>Alone, perhaps, of all other rural occupations, shepherding
remains unaffected by the avalanche of machinery and chemistry
which has descended upon agriculture.&nbsp; Here and there may be
found a flockmaster who talks of shearing-machines, but it is
rare to find anything but the old hand-clippers in use by the
old-fashioned, wandering gangs of shearers.&nbsp; Flocks are
larger, and so bring the modern shepherd more anxious care; but
in all essential ways, his year&rsquo;s round of work is the same
as in that time of old when the <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>shepherds watched their flocks by
night near Bethlehem.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>For the first time, in near upon fifty years, old Artlett has
had no hand in the pen-making.&nbsp; Rheumatism, the life-long
foe of the shepherd, has got him by the heels at last; and, if it
turn out with him as with nearly all his kind, he will never
again leave the chimney-corner, until he is carried thence and
laid to sleep beside his long line of forbears up in the
churchyard.&nbsp; But young George is as good a shepherd as any
of his line, in this, as in all other branches of the
craft.&nbsp; Wherever you go among the neighbouring sheep-farms,
you will hear tell of the amazing good luck of Windlecombe at
lambing-time.&nbsp; George Artlett views the matter from a
different standpoint.</p>
<p>We sat together in his cosy hut on the hillside, towards
twelve o&rsquo;clock of a gusty, moonlit night.&nbsp; The
coke-fire burned in the little stove with a steady brightness,
casting its red rays through the open door, and far out into the
resounding night.&nbsp; Overhead a lantern swung gently to and
fro, rocking our shadows on the walls.&nbsp; From the
lambing-pens hard by there rose a ceaseless yammering chorus, and
from the outer folds a confusion of tongues deeper still, mingled
with the tolling of innumerable bells.&nbsp; George Artlett sat
on the straw mattress in the corner, his knees drawn up to his
chin.</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>&lsquo;Ah! luck!&rsquo; said he, a little scornfully,
peering at me through the cloud of tobacco-smoke&mdash;all from
my own pipe&mdash;which hovered between us.&nbsp;
&lsquo;An&rsquo; how be it then, as them as believes in luck,
gets so onaccountable little on&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Gregory, over at
Redesdown yonder&mdash;&rsquo;a wunt so much as throw a hurdle on
a Friday, an&rsquo; &rsquo;a wears a bag o&rsquo; charm-stuff
round&rsquo;s neck, an&rsquo; &rsquo;a wud walk a mile sooner
&rsquo;n goo unner a laadder&mdash;well, how be it wi&rsquo;
un?&nbsp; Lambs dyin&rsquo; every day, folks say; ah! an&rsquo;
yows too&mdash;seven on &rsquo;em gone a&rsquo;ready!&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill be thirteen,&rdquo; &rsquo;a sez,
&ldquo;thirteen, th&rsquo; on-lucky number, an&rsquo; then
&rsquo;twill stop.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Redesdown&rsquo;s
luck!&rdquo; sez he; &ldquo;ye can do nought agen
it!&rdquo;&nbsp; An&rsquo; next year, &rsquo;a&rsquo;ll goo on
feedin&rsquo; short an&rsquo; poor, jest as &rsquo;a allers doos;
an&rsquo; putten th&rsquo; yows to th&rsquo; ram too young;
an&rsquo; lambin&rsquo; i&rsquo; th&rsquo; hoameyard agen, where
&rsquo;tis so soggy an&rsquo; onhealthy, jest because &rsquo;tis
near to &rsquo;s bed.&nbsp; When a man doos his
night-shepherdin&rsquo;, swearin&rsquo; at th&rsquo; laads
through &rsquo;s windy, &rsquo;a may well look fer bad
luck!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He rose, and drew on his great blanket-coat, and pulled his
sou&rsquo;wester over his eyes.&nbsp; Then he took down the
lantern from its hook, and together we plunged out into the
buffeting wind to make the round of the folds for the sixth time
since my advent, although the night was but half over.</p>
<p>The moon was nearly at the full.&nbsp; In its flood <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>of pure white
light, the lambing-yard, with its surrounding folds, looked like
some extensive fortification, so high and impregnable seemed the
walls that hemmed it in on every side.&nbsp; These walls were
made of sheaves of straw, standing on end, shoulder to shoulder,
of such girth and density that not a breath of the unruly wind
could penetrate them.&nbsp; Within, the lambing-yard was floored
a foot deep with the same straw, and on all sides were the pens,
little separate bays flanked and topped by hurdles covered in
with the like material.&nbsp; The whole place was crowded with
ewes and lambs; the newest arrivals still in the pens with their
mothers, the rest almost as snugly berthed out in the mainway of
the yard.&nbsp; Outside this elaborate stockade were two great
folds, the one containing the ewes still to be reckoned with, the
other thronged with those whose troubles were happily over, and
with whom already the cares and joys of motherhood were verging
on the trite.</p>
<p>Shepherd Artlett took no chances at any stage of his
work.&nbsp; At the entrance to the lambing-yard, he carefully
covered up the lantern with his coat, and thereafter allowed its
light to fall only where he need direct his scrutiny.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nane o&rsquo; Gregory&rsquo;s luck fer me!&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;There bean&rsquo;t no wolves on th&rsquo; Hill
nowadays, but sheep, they be jest as much afeared o&rsquo; <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>summat as
&rsquo;twur born in &rsquo;em to dread.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis in their
blood, I reckons.&nbsp; Now look ye!&nbsp; A naked light carried
i&rsquo; th&rsquo; haand, an&rsquo; let sudden in upon
&rsquo;em&mdash;see how it sets th&rsquo; shadders dancin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; prancin&rsquo; all around!&nbsp; Like as not,
&rsquo;tis so th&rsquo; wolves came leapin&rsquo; round th&rsquo;
folds ages an&rsquo; ages back; an&rsquo; so it bides in
th&rsquo; blood wi&rsquo; all sheep&mdash;a sort o&rsquo;
natur&rsquo;s bygone memory.&nbsp; Froughten wan yow, an&rsquo;
ye be like to froughten all.&nbsp; Set &rsquo;em
stampedin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; that means slipped lambs, turned
milk, an&rsquo; trouble wi&rsquo;out end&mdash;Gregory&rsquo;s
luck agen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>On these rounds, every pen in the yard was visited, and its
denizens critically examined: not a sheep of the huddled,
vociferating crowd through which we threaded our difficult
course, but had her share in George Artlett&rsquo;s swift-roving
glance.&nbsp; Here and there we came upon a newborn lamb, and
then George took its four legs in one handful and carried it head
downwards through the throng to the nearest vacant pen, its
frantic mother bleating her expostulation close in our
rear.&nbsp; There were the feeding-cages to fill with hay, and
mangold to be carried in and scattered amongst the crouching
sheep.&nbsp; Sometimes there was a sickly lamb or ewe to doctor,
when we went trudging back to rifle the medicine-chest in the
hut; and rarely a weakling, who refused its natural food, must be
taken <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>under George&rsquo;s coat, a silent shivering woolly
atom, and restored to life and voice by the warmth of our fire
and the bottle.</p>
<p>In how great a measure the luck of Windlecombe or any
sheep-farm depends on the foresight and tender care of the
shepherd, was well brought home to me as, in the first ghostly
light of morning, something like a crisis came to vary the
monotonous round of our task.&nbsp; I had dozed off as I sat in
my corner, and woke to find grey dawn picking out the tops of the
hills, and George away on his unending business.&nbsp; Presently,
through the little window at my side, I saw him coming back over
the rimy grass, his coat bulged out with the usual burden.&nbsp;
He set the lamb down on the straw by the fire.&nbsp; Limp and
lifeless it looked, and past all aid; but George fell patiently
to work swabbing it.&nbsp; As he worked, he talked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis White-Eye agen&mdash;a fine yow, but a
onaccountable bad mother, &rsquo;a be, surelye.&nbsp; Purty nigh
lost her lamb laast season, an&rsquo; now agen &rsquo;tis
ne&rsquo;ersome-matter wi&rsquo; un.&nbsp; Wunt gie suck.&nbsp;
Butts th&rsquo; little un away, &rsquo;a do.&nbsp; That,
an&rsquo; th&rsquo; could, &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; Terr&rsquo;ble hard
put to &rsquo;t, I wur, laast time, to save un!&nbsp; An&rsquo;
this&mdash;well: if &rsquo;a cooms round, &rsquo;twill be a
miracle&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stopped to fetch his breath, then set to more vigorously
than ever.</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>&lsquo;Lorsh!&nbsp; I do b&rsquo;lieve! . . .&nbsp; Ay!
I&rsquo;ll do &rsquo;t!&mdash;better &rsquo;n a score o&rsquo;
dead uns, &rsquo;a be, a&rsquo;ready.&nbsp; Now, shaap wi&rsquo;
th&rsquo; bottle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the wretched mute morsel of woolliness was too weak to
suck.&nbsp; And then George Artlett did what I had never seen
done before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; he said confidently, &lsquo;we must
try th&rsquo; ould-fangled way wi&rsquo; un!&rsquo;&nbsp; He took
a gulp of the warm milk, and bringing the lamb&rsquo;s mouth to
his own, tenderly fed it.&nbsp; Again and again this was done,
until life began to flicker up strong once more in the little
creature&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But mind ye!&rsquo; said George, as presently he stood
looking down on the resuscitated lamb, and regaling himself with
its pitiful bleating, &lsquo;No more o&rsquo; White-Eye!&nbsp;
Off to Findon Fair &rsquo;a goos wi&rsquo; th&rsquo;
draught-sheep next May, sure as she&rsquo;s alive!&rsquo;</p>

55</span>MARCH</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> charm of Sussex woods, though
you may frequent them at all times in and out of season, is that
they are never the same woods from year to year.&nbsp; The great
trees, indeed, keep their old familiar forms and stations, but
the undergrowth of hazel, ash, larch, or silver-birch is
periodically cleared away.&nbsp; This year, a certain hillside or
deep hollow may be hidden under a thicket of growth impenetrable
not only to the casual wanderer, but to the very sunlight itself;
and next year the wood-cutters may have swept it clean, leaving
only the forest trees to cast their shadows over a sunny
wilderness that your eyes, though you have journeyed this way
scores of times, have never yet beheld.&nbsp; Clearings wherein
the children gathered primroses by the thousand one spring, are
overgrown and all but impassable the next.&nbsp; The very paths
and waggon-ways change their direction, as the woodmen vary the
scene of their labours from year to year.&nbsp; And in the track
of the copse-cutters, <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>arise all manner of new plants; new
birds come to nest; new sights and sounds throng about the way at
every turn&mdash;so, in nearly all seasons, a strange new land is
brought to your very feet, in the midst of things familiar,
maybe, for a score of years.</p>
<p>In the dead deeps of winter, nothing seems so remote, so
hopelessly unattainable, as the March sunshine; yet here it is at
last, and here I am, sitting on a hazel-stole softly cushioned
with ivy, alone and deliciously idle, in a clearing I have just
discovered in the heart of Windle Woods.</p>
<p>All this part of the wood has lain untouched for a decade,
perhaps, given over to the jays and magpies, and other wildest of
wild nesting things.&nbsp; There is a green lane only a few
hundred feet distant, and along it I have journeyed many a time
during the past year, never dreaming that the clearing
existed.&nbsp; And yet, no later than last April, the woodmen
must have been here with their bill-hooks, hacking and hewing,
and letting in the living sunlight where the earth had known no
more than green gloaming on the brightest day.</p>
<p>It is strange how quickly the fertile soil awakens from such a
lethargy of long, dark years.&nbsp; From where I sit, high upon
the sunny slope, I can see nothing but greenery.&nbsp; All that
remains of the dense growth of hazel, that covered this part of
<a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>the wood,
is gathered into great square piles, looking like windowless
houses set here and there on the sunny declivity.&nbsp; Primroses
shine everywhere; truly not in the abundance of April, but still
there is no yard of ground without their sulphur sheen.&nbsp; Red
deadnettle makes a rosy flush in the grass at my feet.&nbsp;
There is ground-ivy round the base of each hazel-stole, with its
pale violet flowers, so minute, yet making such a brave show by
sheer strength of numbers.&nbsp; And hovering everywhere over
this still mere of sunshine, with its sunken treasure of blossom,
are butterflies&mdash;great sulphur-yellow
butterflies&mdash;flapping idly along, little tortoiseshells and
peacocks that have laid up through the winter, and one gorgeous
red-admiral, also a hibernator, veering about in the sunshine
with outspread, motionless wings.</p>
<p>To this secret nook of woodland I came but an hour ago, yet in
that one hour of still March sunshine, I have seen and heard more
things than could be chronicled, perhaps, in a day&rsquo;s hard
driving of the swiftest pen.&nbsp; To set down only the things
that dwell foremost in the memory is not easy.&nbsp; I had been
here only a few minutes when a rabbit came racing across the
clearing, dodging in and out of the hazel-stoles in tremendous
hurry and fear.&nbsp; On seeing me, he turned off at a sharp
angle, then scurried away into the wood.&nbsp; A full <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>five minutes
after came a stealthy rustling from the same direction, and a
ruddy-furred stoat drew into view, his snake-like head
alternately poised high in the sunshine and lowered amidst the
grass, as he carefully picked up the rabbit&rsquo;s trail.&nbsp;
He was going at only a tithe of the rabbit&rsquo;s pace, but
going without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation.&nbsp; Where the
rabbit had turned off at seeing me, the stoat also veered sharply
round.&nbsp; He went straight for the wood, entering it, as far
as I could judge, at exactly the same spot.&nbsp; So he would go
on, I knew, until at last his blood-thirsty cunning and
pertinacity had outworn the rabbit&rsquo;s speed.</p>
<p>Then a woodpecker came over the clearing, his crimson cap and
tarnished jerkin of lincoln-green looking strangely tawdry and
theatrical in the brilliant sunshine.&nbsp; He flew heavily yet
swiftly, arresting the motion of his wings at every four or five
beats, much as a finch flies.&nbsp; As he passed over, he uttered
his weird call-note, that sounds something like &lsquo;Ploo-ee,
ploo-ee!&rsquo; wherein, however, there is a tang of crafty
cynicism indescribable.&nbsp; Not far from where I sat was a
beech-tree, and to this tree I watched him go.&nbsp; He climbed
up the smooth bark like a cat, taking the trunk
spiral-wise.&nbsp; Then, when almost at its summit, he stopped
and beat out of the hard wood, with his pick-axe of a <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>bill, such a
note as can be likened to nothing else in nature.&nbsp; So fast
fell the blows of his beak, that between them no interval could
be distinguished.&nbsp; They ran together into one smooth,
continuous volume of sound.&nbsp; Extraordinarily musical it was,
with a plaintive quality and a variableness of tone, now loud,
now soft, that could not fail to impress the dullest ear.&nbsp;
The note was prolonged for half a minute or so, and then the bird
stopped to listen.&nbsp; Far away over the wood-top I heard the
answering sound.&nbsp; For this woodpecker-music in springtime is
a true love-call, and you will hear it onward through the months
until the last pair of birds is mated in the wood.</p>
<p>This is the time when the queen-wasps come out of their winter
hiding-places, and the first bumble-bees appear.&nbsp; Of the
hive-bees very few seek out these isolated clearings; they have
all gone to the riverside where the sallows and willows are in
bloom.&nbsp; But as I sat listening to the medley of birds and
insect-voices around me, trying to pick out one after the other
from the chaos of song, I heard the soft note of a honey-bee down
in the blue veronica close at hand.&nbsp; Yet she touched none of
the flowers.&nbsp; She passed all by, and went scrambling down
among the moss and dead leaves.&nbsp; Knowing that the honey-bee
never wastes time, and anxious to find out <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>what she
might be doing there, I watched her as she painfully went over
the moss-fronds one by one, sending forth a shrill, fretful note
at intervals, very like an interjection of disappointment at not
finding what she needed.&nbsp; At last her search came to a
successful end.&nbsp; It was a dew-drop she had been seeking, one
of the few that had escaped the thirsty glances of the sun.&nbsp;
Silently she drank.&nbsp; And then, as she rose into mid-air with
her burden, there was no mistaking the triumphant quality of her
song.&nbsp; At this time, water is the all-important factor in
the prosperity of the hive; and the bee knew well she was
carrying home something of greater worth even than a load of the
purest honey.</p>
<p>Leaving the clearing at length, I went homeward by a
roundabout way, through the oldest part of the wood.&nbsp;
Traversing one of the shadiest paths, where the oaks grew thick
together overhead, I came to a turn in the way.&nbsp; Just
beyond, there was a single spot of sunshine lying on the
moss-green path, and in it a squirrel gambolled, as though he
were taking a bath in the yellow pool of light.&nbsp; Often
throughout the winter I had come upon squirrels thus, tempted out
of their warm winter-houses by some day of exceptional
mildness.&nbsp; For the squirrel is no true hibernator.&nbsp; He
sleeps through the cold spells, often for weeks at a
stretch.&nbsp; But, like the hive-bees, warm <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>weather at
once rouses him from his dray, and sends him forth ravenous to
his secret store of acorns or beech-mast.</p>
<p>Old Tom Clemmer once told me of a custom regarding the
squirrel which, in his boyhood, was rife in most Downland
villages.&nbsp; On Saint Andrew&rsquo;s Day, towards the end of
each November, most of the Windlecombe men and boys used to
foregather on the green, armed with short sticks, shod at one end
with some heavy piece of metal.&nbsp; The party would then go out
into the woods for this, the annual squirrel-hunt, or
&lsquo;skugging&rsquo; as it was called.&nbsp; The weighted
sticks were thrown at the squirrels as they leaped in the
branches overhead; and some of the folk, Tom Clemmer himself
among the number, were famous for their skill at this
pastime.&nbsp; Skugging, however, being essentially a poor
man&rsquo;s brutal sport, has been long ago suppressed.</p>
<p>My squirrel in the pool of sunshine blocked the path, and
there was no way round.&nbsp; I must perforce disturb him.&nbsp;
I watched him clamber upward into the wilderness of budding
oak-boughs, his glossy red-brown coat gleaming in the sunshine as
he went.</p>
<p>Presently, coming into a spacious valley of beeches, where the
eye could wander far and wide, between the grey-green trunks,
over a bare, undulating carpet of last year&rsquo;s
leaves&mdash;for <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>scarcely anything will grow under beech&mdash;I caught
sight of an object which drew my steps over to the near
hillside.&nbsp; It was a spot of shining white painted about
breast high on the smooth bark of one of the trees.&nbsp; I knew
what it meant.&nbsp; It was the White Spot of Doom&mdash;the
token of the woodreeve to his men that the tree was to be felled;
and this was the time, when the sap was beginning to run strong
and rinding would be easy, for the death sentence to be carried
out.</p>
<p>I looked at the white spot, and if I could have saved the tree
by obliterating it there and then, I would have done so
gladly.&nbsp; Carved deeply into its wood, and so long ago that
the characters were all but illegible, was a double set of
initials, and, between them, two hearts at once united and
transfixed by the same arrow.&nbsp; Below these roughly-hewn
signs a date appeared.&nbsp; I had often come upon the legend in
my walks, and stopped to ruminate over it.&nbsp; Who had cut it I
never knew, nor indeed whether C. D. and L. E. W., if they were
alive to-day, would have joined with any enthusiasm in my desire
for its preservation.&nbsp; But somehow it came to me at the
moment as an infinitely pathetic thing, that the tree should be
cut down after all those years, and the record destroyed&mdash;it
had been done so obviously for perpetuity.&nbsp; What kind of
stony-hearted villain must the woodreeve have been, <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>I thought to
myself, who could daub that patch of white paint so callously
near to the silent eloquence of such an inscription?</p>
<p>Out of the far distance now, as I lingered over the carving in
that mood of moralising sentimentality, there came creeping up
the hollow stillness of the glade a murmur of voices, and, in a
little, the tramp of heavy feet.&nbsp; I recognised the gang of
woodmen carrying the tools of their craft; and behind them a
little rabble of village-folk, mostly children.&nbsp; I drew off
some way up the hillside, and sat me down on a stump, to look on
at the now imminent, as well as inevitable spectacle.</p>
<p>To watch a great tree felled, especially when such a giant as
this lovers&rsquo; tree was in question, is one of the most
exciting things to be met with in country-life.&nbsp; There is
ever growing suspense for the onlooker from the moment when the
first axe-blow sends its echo ringing through the aisles of the
wood, to that last stunned feeling after the mighty tree is
down.&nbsp; The speed and workmanlike dexterity with which the
gang now got to their task only served to intensify this
sensation.&nbsp; One buckled on a pair of climbing-irons and
carried aloft two long ropes, securing them to the trunk at its
highest point of division.&nbsp; While he was still up there,
like a perching crow black against the sky, another took a great
glittering <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>axe, and, stepping slowly round the tree, dealt it a
succession of downward and inward blows, cutting out a deep ring
all round the bole some six or eight inches above
ground-level.&nbsp; On the side towards which the tree was to
fall, this cut was now widened and deepened until it laid bare a
good foot breadth of the solid heart of the wood.&nbsp; And while
the amber chips were still flying under the axe, the rest of the
gang were carrying the ropes away at two sharp angles, and
binding them securely to neighbouring trees.</p>
<p>And now began the crucial part of the business.&nbsp; The
great wood-saw was got to work, with four strong men at it.&nbsp;
Cutting close to the ground on the far side of the tree, the
shining blade tore its way steadily into the wood.&nbsp; Inch by
inch it drove its ragged teeth forward, and at every lunge it
gave forth a savage gasping scream, and a spume of yellow sawdust
spirted from the cut, gathering in an ever-growing heap on either
side.&nbsp; No other sound broke the stillness of the glen for a
full ten minutes or more.&nbsp; No one among the mute, expectant
crowd, nor any of the woodmen, seemed to move hand or foot.&nbsp;
All watched and waited, as it appeared, breathlessly.&nbsp; There
were just these four strong men labouring to and fro, the flash
of the hungry saw-blade in the sunlight, and the harsh sudden
screech of the direful thing every time it ripped at the vitals
of the tree.&nbsp; The <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>gang of woodmen had divided at a sign
from their chief, and stood, three or four of them bearing on
each rope.&nbsp; The leader watched the saw, a hand on each
hip.&nbsp; Once he raised a hand the saw stopped; a row of steel
wedges was driven in behind it; the saw began once more its old
rasping melody.&nbsp; At last the hand went up again.&nbsp; The
work was done.&nbsp; I could see the black line of the cut
reaching within an inch or so of the deep axe-cleft on the face
of the tree.</p>
<p>Long ago, on shipboard, I had been present at the firing of
one of the heaviest guns that ever put to sea; and what followed
now reminded me strangely of that deafening experience.&nbsp; The
leader marshalled his men, and directed operations with short,
sharp words of command, much as the gun-lieutenant had
done.&nbsp; There was the same busy preparation and skurrying to
and fro, the same moment of suspense, the same terrific
outcome.&nbsp; Every available man was now set to haul on the
ropes, while the leader of the gang himself took a mallet and,
with mighty blows, drove the wedges in.&nbsp; Thick and fast the
blows fell, and their echoes went chevying each other down the
ravine.&nbsp; The vast-spreading tree quaked, lashed its branches
wildly about overhead.&nbsp; The crowd of waiting children and
old women were ordered farther back from the zone of
danger.&nbsp; Now the great mallet redoubled its <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>blows, and
the two gangs of men bore on the ropes with all their might and
main.&nbsp; Still, though the commotion overhead increased to the
force of a hurricane, no other sign of movement other than a
faint shudder, was visible in the trunk of the tree.&nbsp; One
last blow of the mallet, and one last pull all together, and then
a sharp crack sounded, as it were, from the bowels of the
earth.&nbsp; The ropemen leant back in one huge final effort,
then dropped the ropes, and ran for their lives.&nbsp; There came
a slithering, tearing noise as the mighty beech toppled forward,
tearing itself from the clinging, cumbering embrace of its
age-long fellows, then down it came to earth with one long,
rolling, thunderous, crackling roar.</p>
<p>Where I stood, I felt the solid earth quake and shudder.&nbsp;
Between the moment when the uppermost branches of the great tree
began to force their way in a wide, descending arc through the
thicket of intercepting branches, and the moment of the last
terrific boom, as the trunk struck the earth, there seemed a
strangely long interval of time.&nbsp; Another thing struck me
with all the force of unimaginable novelty.&nbsp; All the
undermost branches of the tree as it fell were splintered into a
thousand fragments, and these, flying upward and outward, in a
great cloud, gave an effect as if the mighty trunk had fallen
into water.</p>
<p>And now I learned for the first time why all the <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>poor folk had
followed the woodmen with their baskets.&nbsp; The tree was no
sooner prone on the ground, and the last soaring splinter come
rattling out of the sky, than a rush was made to the spot by
all.&nbsp; Here was firewood in plenty for every one, as much as
each could gather or carry.&nbsp; And it was firewood already
chopped.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>It was Tennyson who first set us looking for kingfishers in
March, though, indeed, the &lsquo;sea-blue bird&rsquo; makes the
riverside beautiful at all seasons.&nbsp; There is a little creek
here, winding away from the main current of the river through a
thicket of willow and alder, where, coming stealthily along the
shadowed footpath, you can always hear the shrill, creaking pipe
of the bird, and generally catch the glint of his gay plumage as
he darts down-stream, or sits on some branch overhanging the
clear, brown water.</p>
<p>But it was from the stern-seat of the old ferryman&rsquo;s
boat that I learnt whatever I know about kingfishers and river
life in general; and these secret excursions seldom began until
March was well under way.&nbsp; For me, therefore, the
kingfisher, as for all Tennyson lovers, is most clearly
associated with the still barren hedgerows and brakes, the song
of the thrush mounted high <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>amidst leafless branches, and that
wonderful array of crimson tassels and brown bobbins, all set in
a mist of pale green needles, which at this time makes the larch
one of the sights of the country-side.</p>
<p>I have said secret excursions; and, indeed, all my relations
with old Runridge during recent years have necessarily taken on
this furtive character.&nbsp; It was not always so.&nbsp; In
happier days, when the old man was a widower, I used to drift
down to his cabin by the water-side for a quiet pipe at all
seasons of the day and openly, whenever the mood seized me.&nbsp;
Then, if tide and the weather served, we would take the little
skiff and go off for hours together exploring the shiest nooks of
the river, either with or without the ancient fowling-piece that
hung over his kitchen hearth.&nbsp; At these times the ferry was
left to take care of itself, which it did sufficiently well,
there being often quite a little collection of pennies on the
thwart of the boat when the old man got back from these
unpremeditated truantries.</p>
<p>But, one fateful day, a distant cousin of Runridge&rsquo;s
arrived on a visit&mdash;a sedate, ponderous woman, very black as
to brows and eyes, and with a hard, shiny face whose colour
seemed all on the surface, like red paint.&nbsp; She never went
away again, for within the month she became <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Mrs.
Runridge.&nbsp; From that day, for peace and quiet&rsquo;s sake,
the old ferryman and I pursued our ancient courses only by
stealth.&nbsp; Fortunately Mrs. Runridge had a genius for
household economy, which led her to eschew the village shop, and
took her off with her basket at least once a week to Stavisham
and its cheaper wares.&nbsp; This was always our opportunity; and
regularly on the town market-days, when Mrs. Runridge and her
basket had been safely stowed into the carrier&rsquo;s cart and
it had turned the distant bend of the lane, the little green
wherry set forth over the shining tide with its
self-congratulatory crew, bent on visiting the
&lsquo;harns,&rsquo; or looking for reed-warblers&rsquo; nests,
or anything else that might fit the occasion.</p>
<p>To-day we went up on the full tide, and turned into the little
creek where the kingfishers have their nests.&nbsp; It has been
one of those dead-still, cloudless days, that so often come in
mid-March just before the gales of the equinox&mdash;a halcyon
day, in very truth.&nbsp; As our little craft sped up the
glittering pathway of the waters, hardly a whisper sounded in the
dense jungle of reeds that flanks the river here on either
side.&nbsp; The treetops stood motionless against the
sky&mdash;one clear, blue arch except where just above the
horizon a series of white clouds peered over the hill-tops like a
row of beckoning hands.&nbsp; The willows on <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>the banks
were full of yellow blossom in which the bees crowded; their soft
music was with us wherever we went.&nbsp; Larks carolled
overhead.&nbsp; Thrushes, blackbirds, hedge-sparrows sang in
every bush.&nbsp; There was a great cawing and dawing from the
rookeries, where the black companies had returned for the season,
and were busy furbishing up their nests.&nbsp; We drove our
boat&rsquo;s prow through the willow branches that all but hid
the entrance to the creek, then let her drift idly down the
narrow way until we gained the broader basin near the footbridge,
and moored her to an overhanging branch.</p>
<p>Keeping quiet and still in our corner, we had only a few
minutes to wait.&nbsp; The familiar, high-pitched cry rang out
from the sunny breadth of the river.&nbsp; And then, into the
cool, grey light, came what looked like a flying spark of emerald
fire.&nbsp; The bird pitched on a wand of sallow that drooped
nearly to the water just opposite our retreat.&nbsp; Here he sat
awhile carelessly preening his magnificent feathers.&nbsp; Below
him the water lay glassy-still and clear, reflecting his tawny
breast and the rich chequer-work of gold blossom and blue sky
overhead.&nbsp; The kingfisher did not watch the stream with that
motionless vigilance that one reads of in the nature books.&nbsp;
He seemed to give the gliding water scarce a thought, but to be
intent only on the contemplation of his <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>own finery,
as he twirled on his perch, reaching now and again over his
shoulder to set straight a feather that had gone awry.</p>
<p>But suddenly he stopped in this popinjay performance, pointed
his bill downward, and plunged like a stone.&nbsp; The glittering
emerald vanished.&nbsp; On the mirror of the waters there spread
ring within ring of light.&nbsp; What seemed like whole minutes
passed in waiting and silence.&nbsp; And then all the brilliant
green and blue and amber burst into view again, as the bird came
up in a scatter of diamonds, and lanced straight back to his
perch.&nbsp; Now we could see he held a minnow, a little writhing
atom of silver, crosswise in his beak.&nbsp; He struck it to and
fro on the hard wood until he had killed it.&nbsp; Then, at a
single gulp, it was down his throttle.&nbsp; Again the kingfisher
sat preening his gorgeous plumage, with the same dilettante touch
and light carelessness, as though the shining treasury of the
waters below concerned him not a jot.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>I often wonder how it is that the old saying, about March and
its leonine or lamb-like incomings and outgoings, should have
kept so sturdily its place in popular credence.&nbsp; Looking
through a pile of old note-books ranging back over a <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>couple of
decades or so, I find that, in the majority of years, March has
both begun and ended in the lamb-like character.&nbsp; The lion
appears only in the r&ocirc;le of an interloper, a go-between;
for, almost invariably, there has been a period of chilly,
riotous weather sometime after the middle of the month.</p>
<p>So it has come about this season.&nbsp; Yesterday was a day
without a flaw; and as the sun began at last to mellow and
decline, dragging a net of shining golden haze behind it over the
western hills, I gave up a day-long, though still unfinished
task, and went to sit awhile on the churchyard wall.</p>
<p>The north-west wall is the last rampart of Windlecombe.&nbsp;
It is made of flint, with an oval, red-brick coping of generous
breadth: there is none in the parish, as far as I know, but can
be comfortable upon it.&nbsp; Sitting thereon side-saddle-wise,
you have a view, on the one hand, of the grey stones and
evergreenery of the churchyard, and, on the other, your glance
can wander unchecked straight down the combe to the river, then
forward over the brook-country to the far-off Stavisham
woods.&nbsp; As yet the light had abated scarce a jot of its
dynamic brilliance.&nbsp; Shadows were long, and the white
house-fronts had taken on a leaven of rosy sweetness; but in the
most retiring nooks it was still broad day.&nbsp; <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>I turned my
back on the serene prospect of level plain, where here and there
the sunlight picked out a glittering coil of river, and set
myself to the contemplation of a remarkable fellowship near at
hand.</p>
<p>Close by the wall stood an almond-tree, its wide-spreading
branches covered to the tips with pink blossom, and behind it
glowered and gloomed a venerable yew.&nbsp; The one tree, as it
were, reached out glad, welcoming arms to the spring, squandering
its all to make one hour of joyous festival at the return of the
prodigal light; the other turned but a niggardly side-eye on all
the inflowing radiance of the season.&nbsp; It seemed to be
trying to do its least and worst, to discount the extravagant
jubilation of its neighbour.&nbsp; For very shame it could not
wholly resist the call of the sunshine.&nbsp; Grudgingly it put
forth, at the tip of each sombre green frond, a sparse sprig of
lighter green.&nbsp; And because the almond-tree threw down its
spent blossom in largesse of rosy litter upon the grass below,
this dour-natured vegetable, turning its necessities to virtuous
account, now shed the dead brown buds of the foregoing year,
sending this rubbish fluttering to earth with the same hesitant,
sidelong action with which the almond petals fell, as though in a
mockery of imitation.</p>
<p>As I sat on the wall with my back to the <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>declining
sun,&mdash;humouring this, and many similar far-fetched, vain
conceits as the best antidote I knew against the day&rsquo;s long
overstrain of fancy,&mdash;high overhead in the church tower hard
by, the bell began its quiet summons for evensong.&nbsp; Through
gaps in the thicket of ilex and laurel, I saw, first, the tall,
gaunt figure of the Reverend go by on the litten-path with his
vast, confident stride, the pallid threadpaper of a curate
flickering at his heels.&nbsp; After them came Miss Sweet, the
rich and lonely spinster up at the great house, mincing along
under a puce sunshade, with an extended handful of ivory books;
then Mrs. Coles from the farm, as ever, hot and out of breath;
finally, at a respectful interval carefully calculated, three or
four of the village women dribbled through, and disappeared into
the north porch after the rest.</p>
<p>The usual weekly congregation being now complete, the bell
stopped.&nbsp; The harmonium gave out one low, sonorous note,
which on weekdays was the beginning and end of its share in the
service.&nbsp; For the next twenty minutes, no other sound
drifted over to me but the clucking and whistling of the
starlings on the chancel roof.&nbsp; And then, having become
again immersed in the affair of the yew and almond trees, both
now alike steeped by the setting sun in the same rose-red dye, I
was startled by a hand on my <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>arm.&nbsp; The Reverend stood at my
side, ruddy-faced, red-bearded, the very blackness of his clothes
changed mysteriously to the like glowing hue.&nbsp; His kind eyes
looked straight into mine, just as if he could see them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A fine evening, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;just one rich flood of crimson without form&mdash;only a
great light spreading up the sky from where the sun has
disappeared; spreading up and gradually paling and changing until
there is nothing but pure blue, with one silver peg of a star
sticking in it&mdash;is it not so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, no, it is not quite that,&rsquo; said I,
considering, &lsquo;the star is there sure enough, and the great
red light.&nbsp; But the red does not merge into blue, it melts
gradually into a wonderful, luminous, metallic green, with the
star, almost white, swimming in the midst of it.&nbsp; Far
overhead the sky is blue enough, and up there more stars are
blinking out every moment.&nbsp; But the green!&nbsp; If you
could only see its&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Snow!&rsquo; interrupted the old vicar placidly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Snow.&nbsp; Wind first, a gale perhaps; and then the
snow.&nbsp; You will see.&nbsp; What says the almond-tree
here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It says,&rsquo; I contended, &lsquo;but one word.&nbsp;
Spring!&mdash;abounding new life and growth; sunshine kindling
stronger and stronger every day; <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>the winter gone and already half
forgotten.&nbsp; With every pink bloom it promises nightingales,
and white flannels and straw hats and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; And you never will grow up now: you&rsquo;re
too old.&nbsp; The almond-blossom?&mdash;it lies in my memory
always side by side with the snowdrop and the
Christmas-rose.&nbsp; Snow-flowers, all three!&nbsp; Wait a
little, and be convinced.&nbsp; But now look, and tell me which
way the chimney-smoke is blowing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blowing!&nbsp; There is not a breath
of&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was more than a breath down there in the fair-way of the
combe, although here we could feel nothing of it.&nbsp; Under the
deep red dusk I could make out the smoke-plumes from the village
chimneys all driving off at a sharp right-angle to the
south.&nbsp; Even as I looked, there came a sudden flaw of wind
overhead that set the yew boughs rocking, and its voice was the
old-remembered voice.&nbsp; The north wind again!&nbsp; Somewhere
in its black tangled depths the yew-tree creaked
derisively.&nbsp; The Reverend put his arm through mine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is mercifully late,&rsquo; he said, as we turned
homeward together.&nbsp; &lsquo;Artlett need not fear for his
lambs now, nor I for mine.&nbsp; Is the sky already
overcast?&nbsp; Or am I only blinder than usual?&rsquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>IV</h3>
<p>After that day I was house-bound for near upon a week.&nbsp;
Later than its wont by a good hour, the dawn broke every day; but
as in darkness so with the grey wan light, the wind never abated
one iota of its whistling fury; the soft thud-thud of the flying
snow reverberated on the panes; the white drifts at the street
corners mounted steadily higher and higher; in the fireplace,
where I already thought soon to start my summer fernery, I had
the logs crackling and glowing with more than their old wintry
might.&nbsp; Poor almond-blossom! I thought to myself again and
again, as I sat industriously scratching away in the strange
dumbness and the thin, queer light that fills the room in snowy
weather.</p>
<p>Yet this was not so ill a wind but that some good was blown my
way.&nbsp; I found myself overhauling arrears of work at a
surprising rate.&nbsp; When the wind fell at last, backing
steadily to west, then to south-west, and there came a night of
drenching rain&mdash;rain that felt like hot tea to a hand held
out in it&mdash;I was ready for any sort of idleness and any
wandering company.</p>
<p>Two long days and nights the world lay under that simmering,
steaming cataract.&nbsp; And then such a morning&mdash;almost the
last morning of the month&mdash;rose over Windlecombe as made the
<a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>mere
awakening in one&rsquo;s bed seem like a sort of first act in a
miracle play.</p>
<p>The sun had hardly breasted Windle Hill before I was out and
clear of the village: its last red tinge had faded into night
when I turned my tired steps homeward, and so to bed once
more.</p>
<p>Lying there cosily, with the delicious ache of thirty miles in
my bones, and in my ears the lilt of a thousand melodies, all the
glad day&rsquo;s journey projected itself like swiftly changing
pictures thrown upon the screen of the starry night.&nbsp; The
Downs first&mdash;the green sea of hills that seemed to heave and
subside as the violet cloud-shadows lazily drove from crest to
crest; the unending sheep-bell music, and lark-song, and the
playing of the gulls high up in the blue, like scraps of white
paper fluttering in the breeze.&nbsp; Then down the steep
hill-side to the sunny flats, where the plovers were at their
love-play&mdash;each pair rising and falling, somersaulting
together, crying continually, coming to rest a moment, then up
again at the old interminable gambols.</p>
<p>Here in the deep ditches the frogs croaked.&nbsp; There was a
golden rim of marsh-marigold to every strip of water, over which
you must peer if you would study the submerged life below.&nbsp;
And what a life there was down in each crystal deep!&nbsp; Queer
water-beetles wove a bright pattern on the surface of the
slow-moving, almost stagnant <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>stream; and their shadows made just
the same pattern on the sunlit weed of the bottom, though here it
was black instead of bright.&nbsp; Down there were mimic forests
or jungles of ferny, bronze-green growth, all in gentle
undulating motion as the water glided imperceptibly by.&nbsp;
Shoals of minnows cruised about in the sunny open, or lay in wait
singly in the shadowy glades.&nbsp; These single fish seemed to
be for ever quarrelling; either making sudden raid on the lairs
of their neighbours, or being attacked in their turn.&nbsp; When
they banded themselves together, evidently making common peace
the better to rout a common enemy, and swam boldly in the
sunshine, I could see that each fish was faintly tinged with blue
and green and orange-red, the identical colours, although vague
and subdued, of the kingfisher, their traditional foe.</p>
<p>Then came up the vision of a long white road barred with
tree-shadows, flowing between thorn-hedges already full of a
green promise of leafage, and edged with butterfly-haunted
flowers.&nbsp; Little cottages passed by, ankle-deep in blue
forget-me-nots, and aflare with blossoming creepers.&nbsp; Deep
pine-woods took the road and folded it in fragrant gloom, then
set it forth in the sunshine again to wander over gorse-clad
heaths, or amidst spangled meadows.&nbsp; I saw the inn, where I
sat awhile in a company of <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>travelling
&lsquo;rinders&rsquo;&mdash;men who strip the bark from the
felled oaks for the tanneries-who would now be camping, like
Robin and his merry rascals, a month long in the woods.</p>
<p>I dozed off, and woke again where, in the drowsy afternoon
sunshine, I had rested under a great pollard ash weighed down
with ivy.&nbsp; Upon the grass about my feet there shone an
infinity of small, rounded objects, much as if Aladdin had passed
by and thrown down a handful of superfluous rubies.&nbsp;
Everywhere their soft carmine lustre gemmed the sward.&nbsp; Year
by year I have found the like on meadow-paths, wood-rides, by the
church tower, sometimes in the very streets of the village, and
have never known how they came into being.&nbsp; You may have
broken asunder the ivy-berries a hundred times, and noted the
pale-hued seeds within, yet never guessed that here was the
mining-ground for your treasure.&nbsp; It is the sun and air that
make rubies of the fallen ivy seeds.</p>
<p>And, for a last vision, as I lay watching the starshine
travelling across the square of the window, I saw within it a
picture, and heard again a note of music, perhaps the most
wonderful thing in the whole day&rsquo;s idle round.&nbsp; It was
a keeper&rsquo;s cottage at the entrance to a wood.&nbsp; On the
steep thatch, white pigeons hobbled amorously; and behind, in a
green bower of <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>elder, a wild bird sang.&nbsp; I could see the bird; I
knew it to be a common song-thrush; but the song was the song of
a nightingale&mdash;not the loud, silver-toned warble that the
poets love, but the low, slow, sorrowful keening that always
seems as if torn from the very heart of the bird.&nbsp; And here
is a pretty problem.&nbsp; If the nightingale were already with
us, singing in every brake, there would be nothing strange in the
thrush&mdash;prone as he is to imitation&mdash;borrowing a stanza
from the new melody here and there.&nbsp; But it is more than
strange that he should do so at the present time, seeing that,
for eight or nine months back, there has been no nightingale
music in the land.&nbsp; Yet we, who are mute fowl, are all
thinking of April now, and what it has in store for us: can the
thrush be thinking of April too?&nbsp; And, as with us, can old
memories of nightingales be stirring in him?&mdash;in him that
alone can sing his thoughts aloud?</p>

82</span>APRIL</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Sunday</span> morning in Windlecombe,
especially when the season is early April and the weather fine,
is, of all mornings, the one not to be spent indoors.</p>
<p>To-day, until the church-bell had ceased its quiet tolling,
and the last belated worshipper had hurried up the street, I
stood just within the screen of box-hedge that divides my garden
from the public way, so as not to obtrude my old coat and pipe
and week-day boots on those more ecclesiastically minded.&nbsp;
And then, bareheaded, hands thrust deep into trouser-pockets, and
pipe leaving a grey trail of smoke behind on the tranquil air, I
lounged out upon the green&mdash;deserted and still in the sweet
April sunshine&mdash;to study Windlecombe under one of its most
inviting aspects&mdash;its seventh-day spirit of earned sloth and
unstrung, loitering ease.</p>
<p>Though the old vicar has held his post here for nearly half a
century, and is better acquainted with the parish than almost any
other, there is <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>just this one aspect of life in Windlecombe which must
be to him for ever a sealed book.&nbsp; When once he has got his
little flock together for morning service, with the church-door
shut upon them, the village and all its doings pass, for the time
being, out of his ken.&nbsp; On wet Sundays, and on the great
church festivals, he knows that many accustomed corners&mdash;my
own included&mdash;will be as infallibly occupied as they are at
other times unvaryingly empty: and thereof he never makes either
complaint or question.&nbsp; He goes on his way, never doubting
but there is some saving good somewhere in the worst of us, and
whole-heartedly loving us all; while we, the black sheep, who
would sacrifice for him our right hands, our money, our very
lives even, anything but our fine Sunday mornings, go our ways
too, satisfied&mdash;if there is meaning in looks&mdash;of his
secret sympathy.&nbsp; For there never was human man, whether lay
or clerical, who, of a fine Sunday morning, believed himself so
nearly at one with his Maker on his knees in a dusty pew, as
abroad in the vast green church of an English country-side.</p>
<p>I had gone no more than a dozen paces over the level, worn
grass of the green, when I stopped to look about me, knowing well
what I should see.&nbsp; Like rabbits coming out of their burrows
after the gunner has passed on, the non-churchgoing folk began to
appear.&nbsp; I saw young Daniel Dray <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>and young Tom Clemmer go off with a
bag of ferrets and their faithful terriers at their heels.&nbsp;
Dewie Artlett arrived at the well-head&mdash;the traditional
meeting-place for Windlecombe lovers&mdash;and stood waiting
there with a big nosegay of primroses in his hand and another in
his cap.&nbsp; He was joined a moment later by one of the girls
from the farm, and off they went together for a morning&rsquo;s
sweethearting in the lanes.&nbsp; At the far end of the green,
the inn-door came clattering open, and that genial reprobate, the
inn-keeper, appeared in his shirt-sleeves, blinking up at the sky
as though but lately out of his bed.&nbsp; Other doors here and
there were thrust back, each giving egress to some happy loiterer
in his Sunday best.&nbsp; Within five minutes, almost every
garden-gate had a pair of brown arms comfortably resting on it,
and voices began to pass the time of day to and fro in the whole
sunny length of the street.&nbsp; By easy stages, stopping for a
word here and there by an open door, or a chat with some old
acquaintance sunning himself amidst his cabbages, I got to the
foot of the hill and so to the river.&nbsp; The ferryman sat in
his boat, but as he returned me for my greeting only a stare and
a scarce-perceptible shake of the head, I knew that our common
enemy was in ambush close by.&nbsp; I made off along the
river-path, and turned into the woods.</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>There
was a blackbird singing somewhere in the budding thicket, and I
managed to get quite close to his perch without being seen.&nbsp;
To the songs of birds like the thrush, the skylark, the robin,
you may listen for five minutes; and, beautiful as they are, in
that short space of time you will have learnt all that the song
has to tell.&nbsp; But the blackbird&rsquo;s song is very
different.&nbsp; It has an endless succession of changes in
rhythm, power and quality.&nbsp; You may listen to it for an
hour, and never hear a phrase repeated in its exact form.&nbsp;
The difference between the blackbird&rsquo;s song, and that of
nearly all other birds, is the difference between the singing of
a happy schoolgirl and that of a prima donna.&nbsp; While both
have melody, one alone has finished artistry.&nbsp; Until you
have stayed in a wood with a blackbird a whole sunny April
morning through, and got from him the truth of things as he alone
can tell it, you do not really know that spring is here.</p>
<p>Now, by the riverside copse, as I leaned on the old,
lichen-gilded timbers of the fence, listening to the pure,
unhurried notes, the fact that it was really April at last was
suddenly borne in upon me.&nbsp; In the daybreak and eventide
choruses of birds, the thrushes, by dint of sheer numbers and
vehemence, easily overpower all other singers.&nbsp; Now and
again you can catch and isolate a matchless phrase of blackbird
music; <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>but
to hear the song in perfection, you must wait until the day is
wearing on towards noon, and he seeks solitude for his
singing.</p>
<p>If bird-song is a language, then the blackbird must be the
supreme orator of the woods.&nbsp; Though you understand not a
syllable of what he is pouring forth, there is no doubt of its
ever-varying meaning.&nbsp; In the midst of a succession of quite
simple phrases, each consisting of three or four notes at the
most, he suddenly gives you a passage whose melodious complexity
is almost bewildering.&nbsp; He constantly varies the pace of his
delivery.&nbsp; He embellishes his song with
grace-notes&mdash;beautiful silver-chiming triplets in the midst
of his lowest, most leisurely strains.&nbsp; There is emphasis,
attack, a sort of blustering use of sheer power of utterance; or
he may run over a slow, quiet tune at his lightest
tongue-tip.&nbsp; At times, indeed, it is well-nigh impossible to
believe that you are not listening to two birds together, of
totally different qualities of voice, alternating their
melodies.</p>
<p>How long I should have tarried there, furtively renewing this
old acquaintance, I know not; but it seems my cover was
incomplete, and the song came to its usual termination.&nbsp; It
stopped short in the midst of one of its brightest stanzas, and I
knew my presence had been observed.&nbsp; The blackbird made
off.&nbsp; There was first the <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>defiant, yet fearsome
cluck-cluck-cluck until he was clear of the bushes and free to
fly, and then away he went through the sunshine to the far bank
of the river, hurling over his shoulder as he went the usual
mocking laughter-peal.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>A week of April has gone by&mdash;a week of rain and shine,
and the singing of the south wind by day; and, at nights, an
intense dark calm full of the sound of purling brooks.</p>
<p>The river runs high.&nbsp; All the streams are swollen.&nbsp;
The low-lying meadows are half green grass overspread with a pink
mist of lady&rsquo;s-smock, and half glittering pools of water
that bring down the blue of the sky under your feet as you
go.&nbsp; You can never forget the rain for an instant.&nbsp; On
this page, as I sit writing at the open window, the morning sun
was streaming a minute ago: now a ragged grey rain-cloud has come
tumbling over the hills, and I cannot see across the green for
the torrent.&nbsp; It is by almost as quickly as I can set down
the words; and now the sunbeams are pouring in at the window
again: the whole village lies before me drenched and sparkling,
the street one long river of blinding light.</p>
<p>Tom Artlett, going by early this morning to his work and
spying me in the garden, called <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>out that he had heard the cuckoo
twice already; and it may well be so.&nbsp; The ringing note of
the wryneck&mdash;the &lsquo;cuckoo&rsquo;s mate&rsquo;&mdash;has
been sounding in the elm-tops all the morning through, and the
cuckoo is seldom far behind her messenger.&nbsp; Nightingale and
swift, swallow and martin, they are all on their way northward
now, and any day may bring them.&nbsp; But time spent at this
season in looking forward to the things that will be, is always
time wasted.&nbsp; Every hour in early April has its own new
revelation, and common eyes and ears can do no more than mark the
things that are.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in a blink of sunny calm between the showers, I
took my midday walk through the hazel-woods.&nbsp; The young
leaves already tempered the sunlight to the primroses and
anemones that covered the woodland floor, giving all a greenish
tinge.&nbsp; Though the whole wood was full of primroses, it was
only by the edges of the fields, where they grew in full
sunshine, that their rich yellow colour had any
significance.&nbsp; Here under the hazels this was so diluted and
explained away by the white of the anemones, and again by the
leaf-filtered sunbeams from above, that the primroses no longer
seemed yellow.&nbsp; At a few yards distant, in the dimmest
spots, you could scarce tell one flower from another but for its
shape.</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>Wherever I went in the wood, the soft droning song of
the bees went with me.&nbsp; You could hardly put one foot before
the other without dashing the cup from the lip of one of these
winged wanderers.&nbsp; But though the anemones and primroses
grew so thick, so inextricably mingled together, the honey-bees
kept to the one species of flower.&nbsp; They clambered in and
out of the star-like anemones, sometimes two and three at a
blossom together.&nbsp; But the primroses were always passed
over, by hive-bee and humble-bee alike.&nbsp; Here and there, I
picked one of the sulphur blossoms, and tearing it apart, made
sure that there was nectar in plenty&mdash;its presence was plain
even to human eye.&nbsp; The truth was, of course, that the
sweets of the primrose were placed so far down the trumpet-tube
of the flower, that no bee had tongue long enough to gather them,
even if they were to her mind.</p>
<p>Yet though the bees might scorn the primrose for much the same
reason as the fox contemned the grapes in the fable, there was
one creature specially told off by Nature to do the necessary
work of fertilisation.&nbsp; Now and again in the general low
murmur of voices about me, I could distinguish an alien
note.&nbsp; This came from a large fly, in a light-brown fluffy
jacket, with transparent wings fantastically scalloped in
black.&nbsp; He jerked himself to and fro in the air from one <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>primrose to
another, hovering a moment over each before settling and
thrusting a tongue of amazing length down the yellow throttle of
the flower.&nbsp; His name I have never heard, but I know that,
until recent times, he continued to conceal, not only his means
of livelihood, but his very existence from the vigilance of
naturalists: Darwin himself failed to identify this
primrose-sprite with his special mission in fertilising work.</p>
<p>It is strange how familiarity with the commonest natural
objects may exist side by side with a pitiful ignorance about
them.&nbsp; I had gathered primroses every spring for half a
lifetime through before I realised that I bore, not one, but two
kinds of blossom in my hand.&nbsp; The discovery, I remember,
came with something like a shock of surprise.&nbsp; Yet there was
no blinking the fact: the wonder, indeed, was that in all the
thousands I had gathered, as boy and youth and man, the thing had
never before occurred to me.&nbsp; There was no difference in the
sulphur-hued faces of the flowers.&nbsp; But while the deep,
central tube of some was closed with a little whorl of pale buff
feathers, in others this tube was open, and there stood just
within it a slender stem topped with a small green globe&mdash;it
seemed at first sight, then, that the sexual principle in the
primrose was divided, each plant bearing only male, or only
female flowers.&nbsp; But investigating farther, I <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>found that
this was not so.&nbsp; Each flower was truly hermaphrodite, only
in one the male feathery anthers were uppermost, and in the other
the green pistil of the female appeared above.</p>
<p>Thirty years it took me to discover these simple, obvious
facts about a thing I had handled every spring since childhood:
how many decades more, I wonder, must pass ere I shall clear up
the final mystery about them, a matter now to me dark as
ever&mdash;how, with the primrose alone, this came to be so; and,
above all, why?</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>If I tell the plain, honest truth about the day which has just
ended, and call it a day of adventure and excitement from its
first grey gleam to its tranquil golden close, I am not sure that
there are many who will understand me, save the one who shared it
with me almost hour by hour.</p>
<p>For nothing really happened on this day, as the world
estimates events.&nbsp; Over an obscure Sussex village, a
mid-April sun shone out of a cloudless sky; certain migrant birds
arrived in the neighbourhood; certain wild flowers and insects
were observed for the first time; there was nothing more.&nbsp;
No wandering stranger appeared in the street, to bring us all to
our <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>doors;
no big-gun practice was going on thirty miles away at Portsmouth,
outraging our blue sky with incongruous thunder; nor did even the
gilt arrow on the church-clock slip an hour at midday, as it
often does, and send us scurrying home to dinner before the
time.&nbsp; To all save two in Windlecombe, the day was just an
ordinary working week-day; but, to these, it was no less a day
than the one on which the year comes suddenly into its full young
prime.</p>
<p>For me it began when the grey eastern sky took its first tint
of morning rose.&nbsp; There is no sweeter sound than the song of
the house-martins, and this it was that roused me now.&nbsp; In
the darkness they had come, straight to their old nesting-site
under the eaves; and now they filled the room with their quaint,
voluble melody, and wove a mazy pattern against the sky as they
circled to and fro.</p>
<p>While I dressed, I watched them dipping and crying in the
sunny air; and, peering out through the window now and again, I
could see them all along under the eaves, clinging to the rough
bricks of the wall, where they had left their mud-houses last
October.&nbsp; But of these none remained now.&nbsp; Not to break
down the martins&rsquo; nests in early spring, before the
sparrows begin to stuff them with grass, is to prepare for the
little black-and-white voyagers&rsquo; war instead of <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>welcome.&nbsp; And they seem quite as happy and content
if, returning, they find nothing but a clay-mark on the wall.</p>
<p>Later, by an hour at most, I had the Reverend by the arm, not
so much to guide, as to restrain him, for he went ever a little
before me through the meadow with the sure, swift stride of a
mountain-goat.&nbsp; There was but one thing that could betray
his affliction to a close observer.&nbsp; While I went blinking
in the intolerable glory of the sunshine above us, and the scarce
lesser glory of the buttercups below, he strode onward, his calm
old face turned straight up to the sun, his blue eyes meeting it
unflinchingly from under their shaggy arches of white.&nbsp; He
might be Gabriel looking into the very focus of heaven, I
thought, as I stole a glance at him a little fearsomely.&nbsp;
Indeed, I never quite limited his vision to that of his poor,
purblind, human eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be down in the little birch-clump near the
Conyers,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;That is where the first
nightingale always comes.&nbsp; It will take us a good five
minutes, and why are you not talking to me?&nbsp; Come! do not
keep all the brave, beautiful things to yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>How to tell him of all the things I saw in a single yard of
meadow about us!&nbsp; But I got to work with the will, if not
the power.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are walking,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;through
buttercups <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>a foot high; and almost with every step we send a cloud
of little blue-and-copper butterflies chevying before us.&nbsp;
Listen to the grasshoppers piping!&nbsp; The buttercups make a
sort of thick scum of gold as on the surface of a green
lake.&nbsp; Down below, like pebbles on the lake-bottom lie the
daisies&mdash;their white discs touch each other in all
directions; nay, they overlap, they are heaped upon one
another.&nbsp; An insect might crawl over them from side to side
of the great meadow and never tread on anything but
daisy-white.&nbsp; And the dandelions!&nbsp; There are millions
of them, I think, filling the air with a perfume like choice old
wine.&nbsp; And smell these, Reverend!&nbsp; Do you know what
they are?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cowslips!&nbsp; They must be in full bloom now: they
were always fine cowslips in this field.&nbsp; But you should
pull them&mdash;never pick them.&nbsp; Then you get all their
beauty, the crimson at the base of the stem, and&mdash;&nbsp;
Hark!&rsquo;</p>
<p>From the oak-clad hill-side to the northward, clear and slow
on the gentle air, came the cuckoo&rsquo;s double chime.&nbsp;
The old vicar faced about, and took off his hat
ceremoniously.&nbsp; I did the like.&nbsp; It was no
superstitious greeting of the bird on its first appearance.&nbsp;
We were not thinking even of the ancient Sussex legend&mdash;that
an old witch goes to Heathfield Fair every fourteenth day of
April, with all the year&rsquo;s cuckoos in her bag, <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>and there
lets them fly.&nbsp; On our part, it was merely a precautionary
measure against a very ancient rustic pleasantry.&nbsp; Farmer
Coles of Windlecombe loved his joke, and that was Farmer
Coles&rsquo;s wood.&nbsp; Though we had no real doubt that we
were listening to our first cuckoo, it was well to be on the safe
side.</p>
<p>The path now left the full fair-way of the meadow, and
meandered along by the edge of the wood.&nbsp; I was bidden to go
on with my chronicle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bluebells are out as thick as ever I saw them,
Reverend.&nbsp; Under the shadow of the trees they look like
purple smoke stealing up the hillside; and where a bar of
sunshine pierces through, the colour seems to leap into the dim
air like a tongue of flame.&nbsp; How the rabbits play!&nbsp;
Every moment they break cover and dart across the open spaces,
two or three together.&nbsp; There goes a spotted
woodpecker!&mdash;I saw his black-and-white coat and crimson
plume as he swung through the bar of light.&nbsp; They are scarce
here.&nbsp; Here comes something flitting along that I wish you
could see&mdash;you know how the orange-tip&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The butterfly with his wings on fire?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
grizzle over me, man!&nbsp; I <i>can</i> see it!&mdash;lazily
looping along, though you think he will fall to earth a cinder
any moment at your feet.&nbsp; He is <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>like Nero fiddling, I always
think.&nbsp; There must be chervil growing close by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, a great bank of it, and the butterfly has
gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well: he is only settling there.&nbsp; Look how the
mottled green and white on the under side of his wings, now he
has closed them, exactly match the colours of the chervil.&nbsp;
All his fire is quenched till you disturb him, and then off he
goes, burning himself up as unconcernedly as ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We rounded the corner of the wood, and came upon a little open
stretch of heathland.&nbsp; The sulky sweet fragrance of the
gorse so loaded the air as to make one&rsquo;s breath come
hard.&nbsp; Over the gorse, linnets sang their slender, tweeting
melody.&nbsp; The blossom-laden bushes spread away before us like
great heaving waves of gold, flowing up to the hill-brow and over
out of sight.&nbsp; Where the crests of yellow bloom stood
against the sky, they made the sky a deeper blue.&nbsp; But
between the gorse-brakes the heather showed no sign.&nbsp; It
crouched low upon the earth, looking black and dreary and dead,
as though a forest fire had lately swept by.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dead!&rsquo; cried the Reverend scornfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Turn up a frond of it, and look at the under side of the
leaves.&nbsp; Each leaf is black above, but see how green and
sappy and full of life it really is, if you <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>look at it
aright.&nbsp; One misses a lot in life by taking too lofty a
standpoint.&nbsp; The heather in April may be black to you, but
it is green enough to the hiding mice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We went along in silence for a minute or two.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what about the trees?&rsquo; he asked
presently.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it death or life there?&nbsp; The
cuckoo never will wait for his green leaves, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Green leaves I see, but leafage nowhere.&nbsp; All the
wood-top is chequered into different clear zones of green, or
grey, or russet, or soft sad yellow&mdash;buds bursting and
leaves just promising everywhere; but leaves, as I want them,
none.&nbsp; How slow it all is!&nbsp; I can understand the
cuckoo&rsquo;s impatience.&nbsp; Flying all the way from Africa
only to find&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had ceased to listen.&nbsp; He had turned swiftly towards
the sun-bathed meadows.&nbsp; He put up a thin
hand&mdash;blue-veined, almost transparent&mdash;against the
light.&nbsp; He visibly started.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heard the throb of a wing&mdash;a new sound.&nbsp; It
must be&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, there it is!&nbsp; The first swallow!&nbsp;
Wheeling and darting over the buttercups yonder, like a bit of
bright, blue-tempered steel!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And as I uttered the words, there drifted out of the
thorn-hedge hard by us the note we had come to seek.&nbsp; All
the ringing music of the woodland seemed to grow mute at the
sound.&nbsp; Wild <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>and pure, with a force and a lingering sweetness
indescribable, the nightingale&rsquo;s song poured out of the
thicket, dwelling upon the one silver, clarion note, moment after
moment, as though it would never cease.&nbsp; At my side two
gaunt arms rose tremblingly into the sunshine:</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are all here!&rsquo;&mdash;the voice was husky,
faltering&mdash;&lsquo;All! all!&nbsp; I have heard them again,
every one of them, the good God be praised!&nbsp; Though I never
hoped to&mdash;&nbsp; Yes, one by one, I bade them all a long
farewell last year!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Down in the village, when I left it this morning, hardly a
breath was stirring under the warm April sun; but the wind is
never still for more than an hour or two, here on the top of
Windle Hill.&nbsp; At first, there was only a gentle wayward air
out of the blue south-west.&nbsp; But already the wind is
freshening as the sun lifts; and, with the growing heat, it is
sure to strengthen.&nbsp; Midday may find half a gale singing in
the long grass-bents around me, the gold tassels of the cowslips
lashing to and fro in the grip of a madcap breeze.</p>
<p>To get the true spirit of the Sussex Downs, you must become a
lover of the wind, loving it in all its moods.&nbsp; There are
rare moments, even on Windle Hill, when the sun glows in a
halcyon <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>sky, and the blue air about you lies as still and silent
as a sheltered woodland mere.&nbsp; But this is not true Downland
weather.&nbsp; A calm day in the valleys may stand for
tranquillity, and be well enough; but here it savours rather of
stagnation.&nbsp; The very life of the Downs is in their flowing,
ever-changing atmosphere&mdash;the sweet pure current coming to
you unwinnowed over a visible course of twenty miles.&nbsp; When
the wind is still, it is good to keep to the lowlands, under
their green canopies of whispering leaves, within sound of their
purling undertone of brooks; for the valley has its own
companionable voices of earth, even under silent skies.&nbsp; But
the Downs are as a strung harp, that will yield no music save to
the touch of the one gargantuan player.&nbsp; Their very essence
of life is in the careering air.&nbsp; You must learn to love the
wind for its own sake, or you will never come to be a true Sussex
highlander&mdash;to know what the magic is that brings Sussex
men, meeting by chance in some far-off nook of the world, to talk
first of all of the Downs, when, in the stifling heat of a tropic
night, or by northern camp-fires, pipes are aglow, and tired
hearts wistfully homing.</p>
<p>Out of the blue south-west comes the gentle wind, bringing
with it the colour of the skies to every dell and shady woodland
track in the far-spreading vista.&nbsp; Violet-hued the lazy <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>cloud-shadows creep over the hills, or travel the
lowland country to the south, dimming the green of blunting corn
and the rich brown of new tilth, with their own soft scrumbling
of azure.&nbsp; Where the village lies, far below at the foot of
the hill, the elm-tops seem full of green: but this is only the
scale of the bygone blossom.&nbsp; It will all fall to earth in
tiny emerald discs, each with its crimson centre, before the true
abiding green of the leaf appears.&nbsp; In the cottage
gardens&mdash;looking, from the heights, like patchwork in a
quilt&mdash;the cherry-trees make snow-white wreaths and
posies.&nbsp; The lane that leads to the hill is flanked with
ancient blackthorn hedges whiter yet.&nbsp; Blackthorn and sloe,
and bright festoons of marsh-marigold weave a dwindling pattern
over the low brook-country beyond, where the grey-blue thread of
Arun river winds in and out on its long journey towards the
sea.&nbsp; And, far beyond all, glistens the sea itself&mdash;one
vivid streak of blue, incredibly high in the heaven&mdash;a long
broad band as though made with a single sweep of a brush charged
with pure sapphire, and fretted here and there with a few scarce,
dragging, crumbling touches of gold.</p>
<p>Swallows go by overhead in the sun-steeped air chattering
pleasantly.&nbsp; Every bush and branch, it would seem, below in
the combe, must have its singer; for how else to account for such
<a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>a
bewildering, dim babel of song?&nbsp; All the larks in the world,
you think, must be congregated in the blue region above the
hill-top, and to be giving back to the sun a dozen gay trills for
every beam he squanders down.&nbsp; While there is daylight,
there will be this incessant lark-song, here on the green
pinnacle of the wind-washed hill.&nbsp; With the first light of
dawn the merry round began: it will hardly cease with the last
red glimmer of the highland evening, when, an hour before, the
leaf-shrouded combe has grown silent in the blackness of
night.&nbsp; The stars will hear the last of it then, just as
they will hear again its earliest music before they are quenched
by the white of morrow.&nbsp; And if a drab, forbidding sky
lowers over everything, or the rain-clouds wrap the hills about
with mist of water, still the larks will sing.&nbsp; Nothing
daunts the little grey highland minstrel.&nbsp; So that there be
light enough to guide him upward, he will soar and sing, carrying
his music indifferently up into the glory of this perfect April
morning, or the gloom of the winter torrent and whistling winter
blast.</p>
<p>Human fret and worry have a habit of keeping to the lowlands,
as all lovers of the Downs know well.&nbsp; You cannot climb the
hill-top, and bring with you all the care that burdened your
footsteps down in the dusty shadow-locked vale.&nbsp; Somehow or
other, every stride upward over the <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>springy turf seems to lighten the
load; and once on the summit, you seem to have lifted head and
shoulders far above the strife.&nbsp; The hurrying mountain
freshet of a breeze singing in your ears, and the rippling
lark-music, have washed the heart clean of all but gladness; and
you see with awakened eyes.&nbsp; You have soared with the lark,
and now must needs sing with him.&nbsp; You cannot help looking
over and onward, as he does, at the brightness that is always
pressing hard on the heels of human worry and care.</p>
<p>It is the great wide expanses in Nature that have most effect
on the hearts and lives of men.&nbsp; The sea has its own
intrinsic influence; but it is too fraught with echoes of old
wrath and unreasoning violence, overpast yet still remembered,
even in its quietest moods.&nbsp; You cannot forget its grim levy
on human lives, and the stout ships beaten to splinters
uselessly.&nbsp; The leviathan lies crooning, inert, under the
hot April noon, all lazy benevolent gentleness; yet you owe it
many bitter grudges rightfully, and see the silken treachery
lurking deep down in its placid depths.&nbsp; But the story of
the Downs is one long tale of harmless good.&nbsp; They have no
record of strife and disaster.&nbsp; Their tale of the ages is a
whole philosophy of life without its terror:&mdash;Nature&rsquo;s
great good gift to world-worn souls, the bringing of calm into
human life, with calm&rsquo;s inherent <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>far-seeing;
reason working through worry towards hope and trust for the
best.</p>
<p>The blithe spring day wears on; the sun lifts higher and
higher; and the blue tree-shadows, that span the village down at
the foot of the hill, have shrunk to half their former
length.&nbsp; With the ripe heat of midday, the wind has
freshened to a surging, roistering gale; but its rough touch is
full of kindly warmth and jollity.&nbsp; The cloud-shadows that,
in the serener mood of the morning, crept so stealthily over hill
and dale, now stride from peak to peak in a wild chevy-chase
after the sunbeams; leaping the valleys in their path, and
filling them with rollicking grey and gold.&nbsp; The sky, with
its griddle of white cloud, has come strangely near, and the
Downs have risen suddenly to meet it.&nbsp; You seem buoyed up on
an ever-lifting tide of green hills, that rock and sway as the
broad bars of sun and shadow drive onward under the goad of the
breeze.&nbsp; It is all sheer exultation&mdash;the changing
light, and the song of the gale, and the lark&rsquo;s unceasing
challenge above you.&nbsp; Now, of all times, you must learn how
good a thing it is to be out and about on these Sussex highlands,
washed in the sun and the rain and the pure salt breath of the
sea.</p>
<h2><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>MAY</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Sometimes</span> for days together, a
whole week, perhaps, I may never set foot outside the area of the
village.&nbsp; These are generally times when the tide of work
runs high, and one must keep steadily pulling to make any real
headway against it.&nbsp; They are days, and nights too, of
necessarily close and constant application, varied, however, by
odd half-hours of quiet loafing hither and thither about the
village&mdash;delicious moments pilfered recklessly from the
eternal grindstone of the study, to be remembered for their pipes
smoked and their talks with old acquaintance at street corners,
long after the labour which sweetened them has passed, maybe
fruitlessly, away.</p>
<p>So it has happened this last week, during which the season has
journeyed out of April into May.&nbsp; At one time or another in
the chain of busy hours, I have renewed acquaintance with all my
favourite bits of old Windlecombe, and the personalities from
which they are inseparable.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>Getting out into the sunshine, I usually find my steps
turning, first of all, towards the smithy.&nbsp; It stands just
behind the Clemmers&rsquo; cottage, its yawning black doorway
wreathed about with elder branches full of white blossom, and
deep green spray reminding one of the foliage in old paintings,
which looks as if it were compounded of indigo and gamboge.&nbsp;
I never knew a smith who could beat out such ear-assuaging music
from an anvil as young Tom Clemmer.&nbsp; If you hear it in
passing, you are bound to turn aside, and stand for awhile
looking in at the door, and fall adreaming under the spell of its
quiet melody.&nbsp; But standing out there, with the sun across
your eyes, you can see nothing at first save a sputtering red
spot of fire, and hear nothing but the chime of hammer and anvil,
to which the gruff, wheezy bellows add a sort of complaining
undertone.&nbsp; When you catch sight of young Tom Clemmer, it is
to make him out as one of great height, immensely broad in the
shoulder and lean of hip&mdash;a peg-top figure of a man.&nbsp;
Through the smoke and flying sparks he shows you a black face
with a pair of grey eyes, deep-set, glittering, mirthful, and a
great head covered with crisp flaxen curls.&nbsp; He is of the
old South-Saxon blood through and through.</p>
<p>But at the wheelwright&rsquo;s yard, a little farther along
the green, you are confronted with quite a <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>different
breed of Sussex peasant.&nbsp; The Drays are thickset, of middle
height; and dark, almost swarthy of feature.&nbsp; Up in the
churchyard, you come upon the two names at every step.&nbsp; You
read Clemmer, Dray, Dray and Clemmer, everywhere amidst the
moss-grown stones, in varying degrees of illegibility back for
hundreds of years.&nbsp; The two families are by far the oldest
in Windlecombe.&nbsp; You note that the Clemmers were nearly
always Thomases, and the Drays for the most part Daniels; while
the females of both races were, and are still, either Marthas or
Janes.&nbsp; Looking over the ranks of this silent company, it is
impossible to think of any member of the former clan as other
than long-limbed, grey-eyed and fair; and a Dray, even though he
were a serf under Harold, who was not dark of glance and visage
would be an anomaly unthinkable.&nbsp; Young Daniel now&mdash;as
you pass by and see him bending to and fro over his cavern of a
sawpit, with the red elm-dust spurting up fountain-like in the
sunshine between his gaitered legs&mdash;must be the very
counterpart of the Dray who, doubtless, fought at Hastings; or
him of older times who, daubed in blue war-paint, might have
watched with wrath and wonder from his seaside ambush the first
Phoenician galley that came adventuring after Cornish tin.</p>
<p>When it rains, though work and the house <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>have for
the nonce become alike intolerable, I have several havens wherein
I can be sure of finding just that quiet anchorage that the
moment needs.&nbsp; The little sweetstuff shop is foremost among
them.&nbsp; Over the long, low window, with its curious lattice
panes of bull&rsquo;s-eye glass, there runs a legend, in one
uniform character and without stop or break:&mdash;&lsquo;<span
class="GutSmall">BERLIN WOOLS TOYS SUSAN ANGEL ALL KINDS OF
SWEETS</span>.&rsquo;&nbsp; And within at her fireside behind the
little counter, sits Miss Angel, always busily knitting, and
always ready for a chat.</p>
<p>I reserve Miss Angel and her flute-like under-flow of
small-talk, for moments of placidity.&nbsp; But at unruly seasons
of mind, I go to the cobbler&rsquo;s den, and getting my elbows
upon the half-door, look in upon him, often without spoken word
on either side, for ten minutes at a stretch.&nbsp; It is dark in
there, with a penetrating smell of tanned leather wonderfully
soothing in certain states of the nerves.&nbsp; My own
taciturnity is real enough at these times; but that of the
cobbler, a garrulous old soul by nature, is usually forced upon
him by circumstances.&nbsp; His mouth seems to be permanently
full of brass brads, which come automatically through his closed
lips one by one, and always miraculously head-first, to be ready
when his quick left hand needs them.&nbsp; With his right hand he
keeps up an incessant <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>monotonous tattoo on the boot
between his knees; and to watch the shining brass pins flowing
from his mouth into symmetrical rows on the leather is pure balm
for eyes tired of staring at paper and ink.&nbsp; I know the
cobbler means to talk directly he has finished his
mouthful.&nbsp; Now and again he looks up with premonitory gleams
of politics or ground-bait in his eye; or, worse still, with that
slow double-wink which I know presages a story ancient even in
his great-grandfather&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; So I watch the flow of
the brads, and when I judge the supply to be nearly exhausted, I
generally execute a stealthy retreat.</p>
<p>The parlour of the Three Thatchers Inn is, I know of old, an
unrivalled place for the rejuvenation of a jaded faith in the
reality of life, at times of idleness and dismal weather.&nbsp;
It is not the talk of the old landlord behind his bar&mdash;talk
at once serenely simple and shrewdly worldly-wise; nor the
unending volley of song from the three canaries, each in its
crinoline-like cage overhead; nor even the quality of the liquor,
that draws me to this cosy, sawdust-carpeted, crimson-curtained
nook.&nbsp; It is the furniture of the bar itself, all that
stands upon its shelves and hangs upon its old wainscoted walls,
that attracts me at these odd, unemployable moments&mdash;a
collection of articles never to be got together, I think, <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>in less
than four generations of like-minded men.</p>
<p>All the woodwork is of oak, planted, grown, and felled, no
doubt, within an arrow-flight of the village.&nbsp; On the walls
of the parlour hang various framed and coloured prints,
disreputable by tradition, yet so embrowned with varnish as to be
long ago relegated into harmless indecipherability.&nbsp; There
is a picture of a bird of dubious species, from whose open beak
issue the words&mdash;&lsquo;<i>As a bird is known by his song,
so is a man by his conversation</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Opposite the
door, where all entering must immediately observe it, hangs
another picture, this time of a dog lying upon its back with all
four legs rigidly pointing upwards, and a very long red tongue
lolling out of its mouth; and, underneath, the
inscription&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Poor Trust is dead</i>: <i>bad pay
killed him</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Behind the bar, the walls are lined with shelves, backed up by
scrolled looking-glass, wherein all the treasures that crowd
before it have their blurred and distorted counterparts.&nbsp; On
the uppermost shelves, hard against the smoke-blackened ceiling,
stand rows of pewter-pots, kept scrupulously clean and bright,
but never taken down for use within living memory.&nbsp; Below
these is a regiment of cut-glass bottles in different rich
colours, quaintly fluted, each with a gilt vine-leaf upon it; and
between the bottles <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>stand inverted wine-glasses, every
one upon a little mat of gaudy wool, and balancing a lemon upon
its upturned foot.&nbsp; Other shelves are taken up with
toby-jugs, curious old snuff-boxes and tobacco-jars, row upon row
of earthenware mugs, ringed with brown and blue, and stamped with
a mysterious ornament like black seaweed.&nbsp; There are three
large wooden kegs with brass taps, marked respectively with the
letters&mdash;O.T., J.R., and C.B.&nbsp; The local pleasantry has
it that these are needed to store the special liquor of three
devoted patrons of the inn.&nbsp; The ferryman and Bleak the
cobbler reject the insinuation with contumely; but O.T., as I
have the best of all reasons for knowing, regards it as a
compliment of subtle hue.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most fascinating item in the whole collection
is a certain ancient puzzle-mug of blue crockery-ware, with a
suspiciously heavy handle and an elaborately perforated
lip.&nbsp; A stranger is invited to drink from this, but, by
reason of the open lattice-work all round the rim, it appears an
impossible feat.&nbsp; The trick, however, is easy to one in the
secret.&nbsp; The handle of the cup is hollow, and communicates
with the interior at its lowest extremity.&nbsp; By setting the
mouth to a small hole in the handle-top, the liquor can be slowly
sucked through.</p>

111</span>II</h3>
<p>It being the day of the fortnightly market at Stavisham, and
the weather fair, Runridge and I took the little green punt from
its moorings this afternoon, and set out to explore the Long
Back-Reach.</p>
<p>The Reach is just a winding side-alley of the river, overgrown
with willows and reeds&mdash;a mere crevice of glimmering water
hiding itself in the heart of the wood.&nbsp; Coming into it from
the dazzling sunlight of the main river, it strikes at first
almost chill and gloomy, for all it is an afternoon in May.&nbsp;
But this is only an illusion that soon passes.&nbsp; After a
minute or two you get its quiet keynote; the green dusk becomes
deliciously tempered sunlight, the cool air something finer and
more delicate than the sun-scorched breath of the open
river-way.</p>
<p>Runridge pulls a long clean stroke, and dips his oar-blades
with a perfect rhythm.&nbsp; He is silent company, as far as
words go; but he has an eloquence of look and gesture which more
than takes the place of speech.&nbsp; And there is something
about his mute system of comradeship that irresistibly impels
itself on others.&nbsp; With his tanned, wrinkled face sedately
smiling under the brim of his battered old felt hat, and his
thoughtful eyes for ever roaming over the <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>landscape,
you feel that the ordinary human method of conveying ideas by
sounds is somehow out of place in the little green wherry.&nbsp;
Over and over again to-day, when a scarce bird or uncommon flower
showed itself on the river bank, and I would direct his notice
thither, I found myself insensibly adopting his silent way of a
waved hand or an inclination of the head, when, in other company,
my tongue would have been set agoing on the instant with less
sufficing words.</p>
<p>Out on the broad water-way the tide was still running up, but
here in the Long Back-Reach the drift of the current was hardly
perceptible.&nbsp; The old ferryman had laid by his oars, and now
sat filling an ancient pipe with tobacco that looked like chips
of ebony.&nbsp; As for me, I lay back in the boat, head pillowed
on clasped hands, dimly recalling a dream I had had, ages and
ages back, of a world without green leaves or
nightingales&mdash;a weirdly impossible world of nipping frost
and firesides, the sob of the winter wind, and the dreary deluge
of winter rain.</p>
<p>The reeds stood high on either hand: above, the old yellow
reeds, with their nodding mauve-grey plumes, and below, the fresh
green growth, wherein the reed-warblers would soon be
building&mdash;a living emerald thronging up amidst the old dead
stems.&nbsp; Over the solid rampart of the reeds the willows
reached down, trailing their <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>ferny branches in the water.&nbsp;
And beyond these, the great forest trees hemmed us in, oak and
elm and beech in two vast cliffs of verdure towering above us,
and interlocking their laden boughs against the far blue sky.</p>
<p>The little sugar-scoop of a boat drifted on.&nbsp; Everywhere
about us the martins were skimming over the clear water,
chattering as they went.&nbsp; The seeding willows sent down tiny
flecks of white, that hovered and dwelt in the dim air, like
snow-flakes; and from the beeches overhead there was a constant
rain of light fine atoms, the discarded sheaths of the leaf-buds,
that fell upon the waters and gathered into all the little nooks
and bays among the reeds like pale, dun foam.</p>
<p>Somewhere far in the distance a cuckoo sang.&nbsp; Runridge
took his pipe from his mouth, and gave it a rocking motion.&nbsp;
Never a word he said, but his thought passed to me just as if he
had spoken it: a see-saw melody it was, and will be until the hay
is down.&nbsp; There were willow-wrens singing far above in the
tree-tops.&nbsp; A chiff-chaff went looping by with his soft,
broken note.&nbsp; To count the nightingales that we heard as the
boat stemmed onward were almost to count the white-budded
hawthorns that shone out through every gap in the reeds.&nbsp;
And now the old ferryman put out an oar, and turned the <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>little
craft towards the bank, where a great willow-tree drooped half
across the stream.&nbsp; The boat-prow clove its way into the
heart of this leafy shelter, and we came to rest.&nbsp; The pipe
went up warningly.&nbsp; In the dense reed thicket hard by there
was a new maytide song.</p>
<p>Of all utterances of wild birds, perhaps none attains to a
human-like quality more nearly than that of the
sedge-warbler.&nbsp; It is not so much a song as a continuous
complaint, and that of a characteristically feminine kind.&nbsp;
To me the little sedge-bird, restlessly flitting from stem to
stem through the waving jungle of reeds, and singing as she goes,
inevitably suggests a type of dutiful, laborious womanhood, all
affection and unselfishness, but ever ready alike with sharp
words and an aggressive tearfulness that disarms as completely as
it maddens.&nbsp; And the sweetness, the occasional sudden bright
abandon of the song only serves to strengthen the
comparison.&nbsp; You can picture the bird stopping in the midst
of her most fretful, self-commiserate strain, bravely to estimate
her compensations.&nbsp; The sun shines, the nest is well-built
and furnished, the larder easy to be filled.&nbsp; Material good
is unlacking; but&mdash;&nbsp; And then the singer goes
hopelessly under again.&nbsp; Now the song is nothing but sweetly
lachrymose expostulation, voiced grief all the more intolerable
<a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>for its
tunefulness,&mdash;an epic of melodious woe.</p>
<p>Turning over in my mind this fantasy about the sedge-bird, as
we lingered under the willow bower, I found the old ferryman
looking at me with a strangely reminiscent eye.&nbsp; It flashed
across me that long ago, when all days were as good as market
days to us, I had put before him just these thoughts, and had
received his silent, amused concurrence in them.&nbsp; Then there
had been no chance of inconvenient application; but now&mdash;I
sat bolt upright and looked closer at him.&nbsp; I was beaten at
this talk of eyes.&nbsp; I harked back to the old safe path with
which I was familiar.&nbsp; He had turned away now, and did not
revert his glance though my hand was upon his arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, why did you do it, Runridge?&rsquo; I blurted out,
almost as forlornly as the sedge-bird.&nbsp; &lsquo;You never
minded living alone!&nbsp; You were happy enough!&nbsp; And
I&mdash;I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was looking at me straightly enough now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do it?&rsquo;&nbsp; His breath whistled in through his
set teeth.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do it&mdash;did ye say?&nbsp; I do
it?&mdash;never!&nbsp; &rsquo;A did it hersel&rsquo;!&nbsp; Kind
o&rsquo; mesmerised, I wur.&nbsp; Never rightly knowed as
&rsquo;twur done, till &rsquo;twur all ower.&nbsp; But there
&rsquo;tis i&rsquo; th&rsquo; book, an&rsquo; no gettin&rsquo;
ower it now.&nbsp; Ah! well, well! purty near time we was
skorkin&rsquo; hoame-along, <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>bean&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Gie tired
women-folk a could kettle for welcome, an&rsquo; &rsquo;tis
trouble wi&rsquo;out end.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Whitsuntide has fallen early this year, and that seems to me
always the fittest thing.&nbsp; It should come, as it has come
now, at the full fair tide of the spring, when the apple-blossom,
last ebullition of the year&rsquo;s youth, is at the zenith of
its glory, and summer is still only a promise yet to be
fulfilled.</p>
<p>Whitsunday in Windlecombe, to all average folk, at least,
excels in importance every other day in the year, Christmas Day
alone excepted.&nbsp; There is neither man, woman, nor child in
the parish, with the ability to get to church, but arrives there
somehow and sometime during the day.&nbsp; For the old vicar,
from his early communion service to the time he gives the
benediction at close of evensong, it is a day of ceaseless action
and exaltation.&nbsp; Every Whitsunday&mdash;when, in fulfilment
of an ancient compact between us, I go to the vicarage to share
the last light of day with him alone&mdash;I find him sitting in
the little summer-house at the foot of the garden, radiantly
happy, yet tired as a navigator, and hoarse as a crow.&nbsp; What
befalls the curate at the end of this arduous day no one knows;
for <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>he
is never visible after the final service.&nbsp; But Miss Sweet is
said to pervade the neighbourhood of his lodging like an unquiet
ghost far into the twilight, waylaying his housekeeper with
offers of night-socks and eau-de-cologne.</p>
<p>On this fine Whitsunday morning I got to my corner in the grey
old church earlier than my wont, before, indeed, the bell began
its measured tolling.&nbsp; The school children were in their
places in the south aisle, a whispering, nudging crew.&nbsp; The
curate flitted about the chancel in his long black cassock like a
bat disturbed from its dreams.&nbsp; The little organist sat at
her harmonium.&nbsp; No one else as yet had come to church.</p>
<p>It was good to sit thus in the cool and quiet before the
service began, letting the heart go back over all the other
Whitsuntides I had spent in Windlecombe, and letting the eye rove
here and there through the hollow, sun-barred twilight of the old
place, comparing the garlands that beautified it now with those
that, in former years, had registered the attained prosperity of
the season.&nbsp; For though, wherever you looked, from the
window-ledges of the sanctuary to the multi-centred arch of the
west door, there were flowers and greenery in profusion, no
garden blossom shone amongst them.&nbsp; They were all
wildflowers.&nbsp; Every child, most of the women, and many of
the men, who could spare an hour from work the <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>day before,
had been busy in the woods and fields to make this House
Beautiful.&nbsp; The old vicar&rsquo;s ambition was known to
all&mdash;that in the church to-day every wild Maytide blossom
should have its place.&nbsp; I looked hither and thither, but
could think of none that was missing.&nbsp; The altar was golden
with cowslips, primroses, buttercups, every flower that bore the
colour of gold.&nbsp; Bluebells hid the old oak carving of the
pulpit, and with them others that were blue or purple, violet and
veronica, forget-me-not and pimpernel.&nbsp; On all the
window-ledges, not to vie with the richness of the painted glass,
white flowers alone were assembled&mdash;chervil and elder,
daisies that are snow-white in the mass, sprays of silver
stitchwort, wreaths of hawthorn entwining all.&nbsp; The chancel
screen was hung with festoons of pink herb-robert and deadnettle;
and the steps beneath it flanked with those wild growths that
bear greenish flowers as well as green leaves&mdash;the
woodspurge and the paler green of arum and bryony.&nbsp; No
colour was crowded unthinkingly upon another.&nbsp; Each blossom
held by its kinsfolk of a like complexion, and a hundred forms
and shades of verdure underflowed them all.&nbsp; Gladly I marked
that there were no roses anywhere, and this it was that gave the
day its special meaning.&nbsp; Last year I remembered how the
wild dog-roses lorded it over everything, making <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>Whitsun a
summer feast, which it never should be.&nbsp; But this year we
are weeks in front of the roses and the may is scarce
half-blown.</p>
<p>Now the bell commenced its slow rhythmic chime, and in the
south porch, where the surplices hung, the choir boys began to
assemble.&nbsp; The west door stood open, and, mingling with the
songs of the birds and the joyous note of the wind in the trees,
footsteps sounded on the churchyard path.&nbsp; At first they
came singly, then in twos and threes.&nbsp; After awhile their
shuffling note became continuous, and the church began to fill on
all sides.&nbsp; I could no longer look about me, but must sit
straight in my pew, contenting myself with rare side
glances.&nbsp; I heard the stump of old Tom Clemmer&rsquo;s
crutches afar off in the street, heard it grow gradually louder
and nearer, until it ceased on the floor of the pew behind me,
and Clemmer set himself to subdue the hurricane of his
breath.&nbsp; Mrs. Runridge fluttered up the aisle, with the tall
old ferryman so close behind her, and his head so decorously
lowered, that he seemed to be regaling himself with the smell of
the roses in her new bonnet as they went.&nbsp; Farmer Coles and
his retinue arrived, blocking the aisle for a full minute, until
hot and flurried Mrs. Coles, by much pointing and nudging, and a
hubbub of whispered directions, had succeeded in packing all her
family into the two great pews.&nbsp; <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>With astonishing suddenness the
erstwhile empty church had become a crowded building.&nbsp; All
Windlecombe was there, every woman or girl in her new Whitsuntide
bonnet and gay new cotton frock.</p>
<p>And now the bell stopped; a few late stragglers came hurrying
up the path, and into the rustling silence of the church with but
half-restrained momentum; a sonorous Amen came from the south
porch; the little harmonium uplifted its voice afar off in the
chancel; the white-robed choristers began to pour up the nave,
singing as they went; the curate followed, and last of all the
old vicar, as upright as any, with his sure, unfaltering
stride.&nbsp; No stranger, seeing him keep the true centre of the
way, and pass unhesitatingly to his desk in the chancel, would
have dreamed that he walked in almost utter darkness; nor when he
faced about, and began the service with that deep-toned serene
voice of his, did any one of us believe it, though we had known
him all our lives.&nbsp; Not a word halted, not a word went
awry.&nbsp; Only when the time for the Bible lessons came did he
give place to his helper; and even at these times we were not
always delivered over to the sad-voiced, diffident curate.&nbsp;
How much of the Bible he knew by heart not even he himself could
say; but often he would come down to the lectern, and with a face
of inspiration turned <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>upon us, recite the whole lesson as
though he who wrote it ages back stood whispering at his
side.&nbsp; Many a time, as he ceased, and turned back to his
chancel seat with unerring step, and every man fetched his breath
in the silence, I have marvelled at the force of habit that, when
all hearts were inwardly exclaiming, could hold us mute of
voice.</p>
<p>The same thought came to me when, a little later, he stood in
the pulpit, his deep tones rumbling in the rafters over our
heads; and most of all it pressed itself upon me when, at close
of the long service, I beheld him afar off in the radiant
flower-garden of the sanctuary, a towering white figure, with arm
uplifted, nebulous, uncertain, in the multitudinous lights.&nbsp;
But, with the thought, came always a kind of fear, a sensation
that we were all living recklessly outside our defences, going
our ways like children sheltered, aided, and
irresponsible:&mdash;what would happen to Windlecombe, and to us
all, when the strong arm failed and the voice no longer
guided?&nbsp; At these times my comfort was always in a word of
Susan Angel&rsquo;s, spoken with a cheery, quiet conviction from
behind her rows of sweetstuff bottles and knick-knack
trays.&nbsp; With her young, almost girlish eyes shining out of
her crabbed, ancient face, she pointed a knitting-needle at me
for emphasis.</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&lsquo;Depend on &rsquo;t, my dear,&rsquo; said she,
&lsquo;&rsquo;a wunt goo far, when th&rsquo; call comes.&nbsp;
Him as has christened, an&rsquo; married, ay! an&rsquo; buried
well-nigh all i&rsquo; th&rsquo; place, an&rsquo; been more
&rsquo;n a faather to us, what &rsquo;ud &rsquo;a be doin&rsquo;
aloane up there i&rsquo; the skies?&nbsp; Na, na!&nbsp; Man or
sperit, &rsquo;a belongs to Windlecombe.&nbsp; Here
&rsquo;a&rsquo;s treasure be, an&rsquo; here &rsquo;a&rsquo;ll
bide.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>I heard a weird, tom-toming somewhere in the village to-day,
and going forth, soon tracked the sound down to cobbler
Bleak&rsquo;s garden that lay at the far end of the green.</p>
<p>The old man was ringing his bees.&nbsp; Through a gap in the
hawthorn hedge, I could see him standing under his apple-trees
surrounded by the hives, and beating on a saucepan with a
door-key, while the air above was alive with flashing wings, and
resonant with the high shrill music of the swarm.&nbsp; This was
the first swarm of the season, although it was well on in
May.&nbsp; Most of the Windlecombe folk kept a few hives in some
odd nook or other of the garden, and these were nearly all of the
ancient straw pattern.&nbsp; He who could get the earliest swarm
was accounted at once the luckiest and most astute of beemen; and
the old cobbler&rsquo;s face glowed with <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>pride
through its encircling fringe of ragged white hair and whisker,
as he pounded away with his key, never doubting for a moment that
the noise would soon induce the swarm to settle.</p>
<p>But the bees were in no hurry to end this one mad frolic of
their laborious lives.&nbsp; They rose higher and higher into the
blue air and sunshine, drifting to all parts of the compass in
turn.&nbsp; They veered out far over the roadway; swept back
towards the cottage, hovering awhile like a grey cloud over the
chimney-tops; took an indecisive turn round the next garden;
reappeared in their old station above the orchard, as little
inclined as ever, apparently, to make a permanent halt.&nbsp; And
all the time their high tremulous music burdened the air, every
dog in the village barked, and every goose quacked its sympathy,
and the old cobbler beat steadily on his pan.</p>
<p>I got my elbows comfortably into the gap in the hedgerow, the
better to enjoy the scene.&nbsp; The garden was completely
surrounded by the hawthorn-hedge, a glowing wreath of white,
against which shone masses of blooming lilac and laburnum and red
garden-may.&nbsp; The little cottage at the back of the shop
stood up to its window-sills in bright colour, every
old-fashioned flower crowding about it.&nbsp; The winding
red-tiled paths ran between borders of the same rich living
hues.&nbsp; And beyond in the orchard, splashed over <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>with
blue-grey shadows and quivering gold, as the sunshine filtered
through the leaves, were innumerable hives, old-fashioned skeps
of straw, each with its little chanting company of bees.</p>
<p>The old cobbler spied me in the hedgerow gap, and beckoned me
to join him.&nbsp; He was without hat or coat, and wore his
leather apron.&nbsp; A half-mended boot thrown down on the path
showed how hastily he had been summoned from work.&nbsp; As I
came up, he managed somehow to extract from the saucepan an
exultant, almost jeering tune.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, ha!&rsquo; cried he, blinking up at his whirligig
property, &lsquo;can ye show th&rsquo; like o&rsquo; that
&rsquo;n?&mdash;you as keeps bees in patent machines?&nbsp; Naun
like straw, there be; as I allers telled ye!&nbsp; These yere
new-fangled boxes!&mdash;ye&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; ne&rsquo;er a
swarm this side o&rsquo; Corp Christian, I&rsquo;ll lay a pot
o&rsquo; six!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It wanted still four or five days to the date of the great
Roman festival of Corpus Christi in Stavisham, which annually
drew all village sightseers from far and near.&nbsp; I reflected
sadly, and rather shamefacedly, that not only was a swarm from my
modern, roomy frame-hives little to be expected during that
interval, but that it was the last thing I had hitherto
desired.&nbsp; Working at home among my trim, up-to-date hives,
with all the latest scientific methods in apiculture at my
finger-tips, it seemed a fine thing to possess bees <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>that had
almost forgotten how to swarm, and that could bring me in a
double or treble harvest of honey.&nbsp; But here in the
beautiful old bee-garden, I began dimly to perceive another side
to the argument.&nbsp; Whether courage or ignorance had led him
to resist the tide of progress in beekeeping that has all but
engulfed this gentlest, most picturesque of village crafts, the
old cobbler might be right after all.&nbsp; My honey was better
and more abundant than his; but it might well be dear at the
price.</p>
<p>The swarm was coming lower now, and the wildly flying bees
closing their ranks.&nbsp; Above our heads the air grew dark with
them.&nbsp; It was plain that they would soon be settling.&nbsp;
Of a sudden the clanging key-music ceased.&nbsp; Bleak pointed
triumphantly to a bough in a tree hard by.&nbsp; A little knot of
bees had fastened there, no bigger than a clenched fist.&nbsp;
But as I looked it doubled its size with every moment.&nbsp; From
all the regions of sunny air above us the bees thronged towards
the cluster.&nbsp; In a short five minutes hardly one remained on
the wing; and in place of the wild trek-song, a dull, uncanny
silence held the air.&nbsp; From the drooping apple-bough the
whole multitude hung together in a dark brown mass, looking
strangely like a huge cigar, as it swayed idly to and fro in the
gentle breeze.</p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>And
now the old cobbler went about the work of hiving the swarm in
the old way, punctiliously observing all the traditional rites of
the craft.&nbsp; A jar of ale was brought out, from which we must
both drink, to sweeten our breath for the coming ceremony.&nbsp;
Then, having washed his hands, Bleak set about the dressing of
the hive.&nbsp; It was a new skep, one of many he had himself
made during the long winter evenings bygone.&nbsp; He gathered
first a handful of mint and balm and lavender, and with this he
carefully scrubbed out the skep.&nbsp; Then he made a syrup of
brown sugar and beer, wherewith he gave the hive a second
thorough dressing.&nbsp; Finally, having cut two or three leafy
boughs of elder, he took the skep with its baseboard under his
arm, and approached the swarm on tiptoe and with bated
breath.</p>
<p>The bees hung in the sunshine, as silent, as inert as ever;
except that a dozen or so were hovering about the cluster,
humming a drowsy song.&nbsp; The note contrasted oddly with the
wild merry music of the flying swarm, when all had seemed mad
with excitement, as though they were setting forth on some fierce
neck-or-nothing adventure, instead of the rather tame business in
which they were at present absorbed.</p>
<p>The old beeman stepped warily towards them, <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>and holding
the skep mouth upwards beneath the cluster, gave the branch a
vigorous shake.&nbsp; Like so many blackcurrants, the entire mass
of bees rattled down into the hive, when the baseboard was
swiftly clapped over them, and the whole inverted and placed upon
the ground.&nbsp; Waiting a minute or two, the old man then
gently raised one edge of the skep, and propped it up with a
stone.&nbsp; A few hundred bees came tumbling out with a sound
like the boiling-over of a cauldron; but the greater part of the
swarm remained within the hive.&nbsp; Before half an hour had
passed, they had completely accepted the situation, and the
worker-bees were lancing busily off in all directions in search
of provender for the new home.</p>
<p>The old cobbler&rsquo;s prediction that I should have no swarm
by Corpus Christi, fell true enough.&nbsp; Every day I watched
until the hours for swarming had passed by eventlessly.&nbsp; And
then, on the great Stavisham feast-day, in the sunny calm of
afternoon, I followed the straggling line of sightseers by the
river-way to the town.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>A hush is over the little precipitous market-town.&nbsp; The
hot May sun beats down on the waiting lines of people, on the <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>fragrant
linden-trees shading the quiet street, on the fluttering banners
and pennants everywhere.</p>
<p>The air is full of dim sound; wild drift of far-off
bell-music, the deep hum and stir of the expectant people, the
voice of the wind, sweet and low, in the green lime labyrinth
overhead.&nbsp; Every glance is turned up the street, where the
church of Saint Francis of Assisi lifts its bluff sandstone tower
against the blue.&nbsp; The great west door stands open.&nbsp;
Straining the eye, the nearest watchers can just make out a glint
of altar lights through the cavernous dark within&mdash;the rich
uncertain glow of candles given back from a thousand gleaming
points of silver chalice and golden cross and glittering
filigree.</p>
<p>And now the last rumbling harmony of the organ dies
away.&nbsp; For a moment a deeper silence than ever fills the
Gothic gloom.&nbsp; Then the thin fine note of a clarinet lifts
up its trembling signal in the darkness.&nbsp; The brazen
trombones join in with their passionate, deep-voiced music.&nbsp;
The lights begin to move and dance, growing nearer and
stronger.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are coming!&rsquo;&mdash;to the
remotest end of the waiting line the whisper spreads.</p>
<p>Slowly the procession winds its way through the great church
door, and down the precipitous street.&nbsp; First the gilded,
jewel-encumbered cross, borne aloft by a young priest in a black
cassock and snowy, deep-laced surplice.&nbsp; Then the <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>singing
multitude of schoolgirls, all in white, with wreath-crowned veils
like so many Lilliputian brides.&nbsp; Now the boys from the
convent seminary in crimson shoulder-sashes, with their fussing
marshals; and the elder women after, in their doleful, decorous
black.&nbsp; Banners swaying; rainbow streamers flying; the
shrill child-voices blent with the sound of the wind in the glad
green leaves overhead.</p>
<p>Now the trumpets and clarinets have turned the bend of the
street.&nbsp; The singing gives way to deeper music.&nbsp; More
banners come flinging and flaunting into the sunny vista.&nbsp;
The gay procession takes on a darker tinge.&nbsp; Sisters in
black, sisters in brown, sisters in grey; weary faces, sad faces,
comely faces; winter and glowing spring and ripe calm autumn, all
in the same cold livery of sorrow, all with the like abandonment
to destiny so plainly fettering the innate unrule of will.</p>
<p>The musicians pass on: the deep blurring melody fades: the
pageant changes.</p>
<p>Monks and friars now.&nbsp; An old Capuchin father totters by
in his rough brown frock, carrying a candle on a brazen
stick.&nbsp; After him a score of his own degree, all bearing
lights that glimmer and blink superfluously in the sunshine, and
all chanting a long slow antiphon in a minor key.&nbsp; Old men
reeking of the cloister, bent nearly <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>double with their weight of years;
sturdy young friars, ruddy-jowled, tonsured, with only half an
eye to their book; suave-faced, grey-headed superiors, eyes in
the sky, calm, transfigured, the vanquished world behind every
man&rsquo;s broad back.</p>
<p>And now a weird, dirge-like note creeps down the sun-bathed
street, and a murmur follows it through the craning, nudging
crowd.&nbsp; The end, the crown, of the pageant is suddenly in
view.&nbsp; It is all shining celestial white now, as the
choristers sweep slowly by in their spotless lawn and lace,
chanting their pseudo-requiem as they move.&nbsp; Behind them a
bevy of major priests, of comfortable figure, gorgeously
caparisoned.&nbsp; Little scarlet-robed acolytes walking
backwards and strewing the way with rich-hued flowers; swinging
censers vouchsafing their hallow of dim smoke upon the common
air.&nbsp; And then at last&mdash;under the great square
baldacchino&mdash;the old Roman bishop himself, holding aloft the
precious monstrance, like a glittering captive star.</p>
<p>A vision now of billowing white and gold; and the low, sad
chant swelling, falling; and the languorous fragrance of the
incense and the trampled flowers.&nbsp; Wrapped to the eyes in
his heavy, gilt-encrusted cope, the old priest grasps his
cherished burden with all the little might of his trembling
blue-veined hands.&nbsp; His eyes are on the gold-rayed
treasure-casket, held but an <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>inch or two beyond his flushed,
illuminated face.&nbsp; A trance-like stupor seems to be upon him
as he moves, guided on either side by those other two, almost as
splendidly robed as himself, who keep a grip on the fringe of his
silken coat, and lead him onward in his passionate ecstasy,
treading thin air, enrapt, magnificent with other-worldly
light.</p>
<p>It is over now.&nbsp; The great canopy has moved on, its
bearers keeping ceremonious step and step.&nbsp; More richly
accoutred priests follow in a holy rear-guard.&nbsp; Then the
crowd closes up eagerly behind, and surges after them,
bare-headed, jostling together; catching now and again a phrase
of the mournful melody, and giving it an echo that sobs away into
silence far in the sunny length of the street.</p>
<p>As I stand apart, here in the deep shadow of the convent wall,
the thronging multitude sweeps by, growing thinner with every
moment.&nbsp; The gleaming star of the monstrance sends back a
last clear flash of sunlight as it turns the distant foot of the
hill.&nbsp; Soon the straggling human fringe of the procession
vanishes after it.&nbsp; A debris of blossom litters the long
deserted way.&nbsp; Flags and streamers wave their bright hues
over the dusty solitude.&nbsp; The street is forsaken, quiet
again; save for the bells in the upper air, and the wind in the
trees.</p>
<h2><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>JUNE</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> morning, for the first time in
the year, I found myself unconsciously taking the shady side of
the way.&nbsp; It was a small thing, truly; but it stood as an
index of something great, perhaps the most portentous thing that
happens annually in the life of him who is a countryman at heart
and not merely by name.&nbsp; Summer had come in.&nbsp; It was
not only that the calendar told me the month was June.&nbsp; I
felt it in the sunbeams, saw it in the hedgerows and trees, read
it in the pure azure of the summer sky.&nbsp; I took the shady
side of the lane unthinkingly, and laughed because I did
it;&mdash;not that I laughed for that alone, but because gladness
was welling up within me unbidden, irresistible: I laughed for
the same reason that the nightingale sang in the green
brier-thicket hard by.</p>
<p>I stopped to listen to the song.&nbsp; It was June, and the
nightingales would not be singing much longer.&nbsp; Perhaps in a
week&rsquo;s time, at the worst, <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>their music would be done.&nbsp; I
silenced my footfall in the long grass by the wayside, and crept
up close to the nightingale&rsquo;s bower.</p>
<p>Every year a nightingale came to this brier-bush, and sang
there as she was singing now.&nbsp; The hedge was a very old one,
lifting its dense green barrier ten feet or more against the
sunny southern sky; and, in all the years I could recall, the
brier-bush had never been without its nightingale.&nbsp; This one
must have her nest close by, where all her ancestors must have
built their nests, for how many generations back, who can
say?&nbsp; The life of this old hedge, towering far above me, and
nearly as broad as it was high, could not be compassed by a
man&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; It was thick and tall when the oldest in
the village was but a child.&nbsp; At long irregular intervals of
years it had been trimmed, cut back; but the growth of the
gnarled old stems, where they sprang from the ground, had not
been checked.&nbsp; There its age stood recorded; and it would be
little wide of the truth to think of it as already thick and
tall, already the traditional singing-place of this race of
nightingales, a full hundred years ago.</p>
<p>The brier-bush stood on the shady side of the way.&nbsp; The
nightingale had her perch in the sunshine beyond, so that the
song filtered down to me through the tangle of intervening
leaves.&nbsp; <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>And yet it was not so much a song as a detached,
occasional reverie on the summer&rsquo;s morning.&nbsp; There is
always this about the music of the summer migrant birds.&nbsp;
They are creatures of eternal sunshine.&nbsp; Their life is no
give-and-take of good and evil, like that of the birds who stay
with us all the year through.&nbsp; They have no need to hearten
themselves with memories of bygone sunbeams, to bring brightness
from within when all without is lowering and grey.&nbsp; Wisely
following the sun about the world from season to season, they
ensure for themselves that the joy they sing of is never a
memory, but always the expression of the moment&rsquo;s living
fact: they have but to turn the vision, the aspect of the hour,
into its equivalent of music.</p>
<p>More than all, you see this truth exemplified in the songs of
chaffinch and willow-wren, which are so much alike in form, yet
so strangely different in the spirit.&nbsp; The hardy chaffinch
began his bubbling, rollicking song with the first warm day in
March, and it was more than half a fiction: to-day it has the
same hard, set quality, like a petrified laugh in the
woods.&nbsp; But the little willow-wren is the slave of no long
habit of pretences.&nbsp; She has followed the sun from the
south, keeping up with his youth; and now, from the glowing
wood-top, she sends down her slender echo of chaffinch music, as
if, <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>though she would fain be silent, she must sing for very
joy of the light.&nbsp; There is in it all the verve and gaiety
of the chaffinch, yet infinitely softened and etherealised.&nbsp;
And the long bowling phrase is never finished: it falls away and
fails in the end, as if the singer suddenly realised her
impotence to convey in melody one fraction of the morning&rsquo;s
loveliness and light.</p>
<p>Invisible through the dense tangle of the brier-bush, to me a
voice and nothing more, the nightingale sat in her nook on the
sunny side of the hedgerow, pouring out her song on the already
song-burdened morning as a gilder lays gold upon gold.&nbsp; All
its sweetness, its wild purity, its slow, sorrowful strength, and
its sudden overtripping, overmastering joy, drifted out upon the
sunshine of the meadow, the varied phrases coming turn and turn
about with long intervening silences, as though the singer
ruminated on all the beauty before her, and unconsciously sang
her thoughts aloud.&nbsp; It was good to stand there in the cool
shade, and listen, and take the facts of the thronging meadow
life and colour beyond the hedgerow at such tuneful
second-hand.&nbsp; But at length the nightingale put such a call,
such an insistence into her music, as sent me to the meadow-gate
a little way down the lane, just to see with my own eyes what
manner of beauty could be to her so great an inspiration.&nbsp;
Shading my eyes <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>with my hands, I looked out over the mowing-grass, and
thanked God it was June.</p>
<p>Knee-deep, almost, the grass stood under the morning sun;
intensely green below, and above, white with the white of
countless marguerites; and, higher still, rich rose-red with
myriads of tremulous sorrel-plumes.&nbsp; A little way over the
meadow, the green of the grass-blades was lost, and the eye saw
only the white of the great moon-daisies, and the
sorrel-red.&nbsp; Farther still, these two merged into one
surface of formless pink, upon which the breath of the slow
western air drew a rippling pattern like watered silk.</p>
<p>I passed through the gate, and waded into the grass to the
farthest limit of the oak-shadow.&nbsp; All round the meadow
these shadows lay upon the mowing-grass, blue and cool in the
universal glare.&nbsp; It mattered nothing which way the sunshine
fell.&nbsp; The green oak-boughs stretched out so far and so low
that there was shadow beneath them everywhere.&nbsp; Just where I
stood there was a patch of poor and stony soil.&nbsp; The
tall-growing plants had shunned it, leaving it a little haven
where the unconsidered trifles could see sunshine and flourish in
their little might.&nbsp; Faced with the rich bewilderment of
summer growth, a spot like this offers irresistible
attraction.&nbsp; To look for long on great magnificence
unwearied is a power not given to all.&nbsp; I know with what
relief and <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>pleasure, in other times, I have turned my back on
snow-pinnacled mountains and soothed dazed eyes with a spot of
grey-green lichen on a common stone.&nbsp; And now I turned from
the boundless meadow radiance before me as from glory
intolerable, and knelt to look awhile at the tiny, creviced
beauties that lay among the clods.</p>
<p>There were scarlet pimpernel and lily-bind, gold-eyed
cinquefoil and blue veronica&mdash;a score of nameless atoms
starring the drab bare soil.&nbsp; Stooping lower, I noticed what
I had never marked before&mdash;how the red of the pimpernel was
centred with a crimson heart; crimson and scarlet&mdash;the
military colours that I had always thought execrable, because
unnaturally blended&mdash;here they were brought together,
justified by the infallible artistry of the sun.&nbsp; The
veronica seemed all pure cobalt blue as I stood gazing down upon
it; but, looked at closely, each minute flower revealed a
complication of colour.&nbsp; The blue of its petals was not a
simple tint throughout, but was striped with a darker blue down
in the cup.&nbsp; From its centre of sulphur-yellow three spires
uprose, the one rich purple, the other two of a pale mauve.&nbsp;
And, as if this were not enough beauty for so small a thing, the
slender stalk upon which each blossom trembled was a shaft of
delicate, translucent crimson, feathered over with white.</p>
<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>The
cinquefoil was just as minutely wonderful in its way.&nbsp;
Studded with little flat golden blossoms, its ferny growth
mingled everywhere with the other rich-hued things, but it held
itself aloof from them all.&nbsp; Even under the full noontide
sun it preserved its chilly, star-like quality.&nbsp; Its pale
silvery fronds seemed to quench the very sunbeams as they fell,
and to make a cold spot on the earth in the midst of all the
glowing soaring meadow-colour, like frost in fire.&nbsp; Many a
time, in former years, I had looked at the cinquefoil thus, and
marvelled at the ice-cold virtue of a thing that could so repel
the fierce Tarquin of a summer sun.&nbsp; Nursing the fancy, I
would grant it nothing at length but a senseless chastity done up
in silver paper; as zealously guarded as little worth.&nbsp; But
now I took the pains to pluck a few of its flowers, and
discovered something new about it, something that raised its
value to me a hundredfold.&nbsp; In all the meadow there was
scarce another blossom with so sweet a scent; it was like the
may, but at once more poignant and delicate.&nbsp; And, thinking
of the may, I straightway forgot all about the cinquefoil, and
turned to wander along the hedge.</p>
<p>The time had gone by when the hawthorn overran all the
country-side with its billows of white blossom.&nbsp; These
blinding masses of white&mdash;snow-white and cold as
snow&mdash;are wonderful to look <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>upon for a moment or two; but to me
the hawthorn is always more lovely at the beginning, and, most of
all, towards the end of its flowering life.&nbsp; At neither of
these times is it really white.&nbsp; The new-opened blossom of
the may is full of pink anthers that, in the aggregate, colour
the whole bush.&nbsp; At this hour, for it is no more than an
hour, the hawthorn-hedge is besieged by hordes of honey-sippers;
hive-bees for the most part, but also every insect that can
fly.&nbsp; Each flower keeps its rosy blush only so long as it
remains unfertilised; and then colour and song forsake it
together.&nbsp; The full-blown hedges of hawthorn have nothing
for the ear, as they have little abiding solace to the eye.</p>
<p>But now again, as I roved along the narrow green way between
the hedgerow and the tall grass of the meadow, the may, as of
old, was beautiful to look upon.&nbsp; The pink anthers were
dead, brown, shrivelled in their drained chalices; but the petals
themselves, as they faded, had taken upon themselves a rich
flush&mdash;the hectic of decay.&nbsp; Everywhere the hedgerow
was wreathed and posied with this soft tint, the colour of
old-rose.&nbsp; It was the colour of death, and that was often
gay and bright enough, I knew.&nbsp; It seemed an ill thing
wherein to delight on such a brave June morning.&nbsp; But the
truth stuck fast in the mind, for all that: these festoons of <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>dying may
were nearly as beautiful as the best that youth and life could
show.</p>
<p>Nearly&mdash;yet as I wandered on, creeping from bay to bay of
green shadow, and edging round the great jutting promontories of
hedgerow-growth, I came at once upon a sight and a sound that
brought me to a more wondering halt than ever.&nbsp; It was my
brier-bush again, and the nightingale was still singing, as I had
heard her from the lane an hour ago.&nbsp; But now I no longer
stood outside her concert-hall.&nbsp; I was here with her on the
meadow side of her bower, and understood at last the full import
of her singing.&nbsp; While on the shaded northern flank of the
hedge there was nothing but greenery, here, on the sunny side,
the brier-sprays were putting forth antlered buds, and one of
them, close to my hand, had opened into the perfect flower.&nbsp;
It was the first wild rose.&nbsp; If I had been Rip van Winkle,
there and then waking from an age-long sleep, I should have known
the day of the month, almost the very hour.&nbsp; Rarely, six
days of June may pass in southern England, but never a seventh,
without this master-sign of summer.&nbsp; Though storm and chill
hold back the music of the migrant birds, they cannot daunt the
English roses.</p>
<h3><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>II</h3>
<p>A stranger observant of trifles, coming into Windlecombe any
time during early summer, might note one common feature of the
place, not remarkable at other seasons.&nbsp; All the
garden-gates were kept carefully closed; and all houses abutting
on the street had their doors either shut altogether, or replaced
by low boards or fence-bars.&nbsp; Even the gate of the
churchyard, open day and night at other times, was now closed as
heedfully as any; and, more curious still, the entrance to the
inn, where there were no children to come wandering out and none
dare intrude, was as cautiously barriered as the rest.</p>
<p>Plainly these obstructions were not set up against absconding
babies, for the tiniest of them was invariably out-of-doors
playing in the dust of the street.&nbsp; And yet there was no
other visible explanation of the phenomenon.&nbsp; It was a
puzzle of a mildly interesting kind, giving just that gentle spur
needed by the tired brain of a citizen holiday-maker, escaped
into villagedom for awhile, and lolling there, genially, yet
rather contemptuously, agape at the silence and sloth of country
things.</p>
<p>But if tide and weather served, any moment of the day might
bring the desired solution of the mystery.&nbsp; From afar over
the hills, a deep low <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>clamour would begin to invade the
songful village quiet.&nbsp; Then, on the crest of the nearest
hilltop, a column of white dust would suddenly spurt up against
the blue, and spread slowly downwards, marking the winding course
of the lane as with smoke from a travelling fire.&nbsp; Now by
degrees the tumult would grow louder and deeper, revealing itself
at last as the hoarse medley of voices from a flock of sheep; a
flock so vast that, while the first ewes were already charging
into the village, the last ones had not yet breasted the top of
the hill.</p>
<p>There would be no doubt now of the wisdom of the gate-shutting
policy.&nbsp; Any of these that by chance had remained open,
would be hastily clapped to; and all about him the stranger would
see the children scramble into corners, and mount upon doorsteps
out of the way of the tornading host.&nbsp; He himself, indeed,
would be glad to take shelter in the nearest doorway, where he
could look on at a spectacle, stirring even to a nature dulled by
the din of a town.</p>
<p>Now the hoarse note has swelled to a veritable hurricane of
sound.&nbsp; The whole village bids fair to be submerged and
swept away by an avalanche of wool.&nbsp; In the forefront
marches a shepherd-boy, straw knapsack on back and blue cotton
umbrella under arm.&nbsp; Behind him the street is packed with
the jostling, vociferating crowd of <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>sheep, a solid mass of woolly life
extending as far as eye can penetrate the cloud of dust.&nbsp; At
intervals in the throng walk the under shepherds, each with his
dog, all&mdash;dogs and men&mdash;adding their voices to the
general uproar.&nbsp; And at the end of the procession, when at
length it has stormed its way past, comes the master-shepherd, a
figure shadowy, indistinct in the dust-laden air; nothing certain
about him but the glint of the sun on his crook, and his easy,
hearty replies to the shouted greetings of old acquaintance by
the way.</p>
<p>Every day in June, while the tides last, and there is water
enough in the river for the work of sheep-washing, these great
flocks pour through Windlecombe, some of them coming from lonely
farmsteads miles away over the Downs.&nbsp; Today it was the
Ambledown wash, one of the largest of the year; and when the
sheep had gone through, and the dust had cleared from the
sunshine, I set off myself, in oldest garb and thickest boots, to
join the string of onlookers drifting from all parts of the
village towards the washing-creek.&nbsp; But on these sheep-wash
days, there is much more to do than look on at one of the most
fascinating and exhilarating sights in all the round of farm
work.&nbsp; A helping hand from every man used to the task is
alike expected and freely given as a point of honour <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>at these
times.&nbsp; Each of us has his favourite wash, in which, as a
matter of old custom, he takes his share of the heat and burden
of the day; and to me, when Ambledown&rsquo;s turn comes round,
is given, now by old-established and hard-won right, the long
crook by the plunge.</p>
<p>As life journeys on, we tend to make ever less and less of our
rare moments of swelling pride and self-satisfaction, or even to
abrogate them altogether.&nbsp; But on this one day of the year,
when I exchange a less noble tool for the long crook at Ambledown
sheep-wash, and feel the cares of my office gathering upon me, I
go back nearer to the child&rsquo;s pure joy in a paper
cocked-hat and tin epaulettes than at any other moment of my
life.&nbsp; If you have never stood wide-legged, like a
ship-captain in a gale, on a rickety hurdle six feet above a
chaos of swirling, glittering water, crowded with the bobbing
heads of sheep, your charge being not only to keep each ewe
swimming down the wash to the tubmen, but to sustain a constant
watch on the weaklings and prevent them drowning&mdash;you have
never known responsibility&rsquo;s true zest.&nbsp; Picture to
yourself an old chalk-quarry on the river&rsquo;s brink, long
disused and abandoned to every form of wild life&mdash;a shy,
green place overgrown with brier and bramble, merged at all other
times of the year in eternal quiet, but now the scene of brisk <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>activity,
crowded with busy folk and innumerable sheep, and echoing with
voices and laughter.&nbsp; The washing-creek is a sort of bay of
the river, a long strip of water caged in by lofty fences, topped
by a platform of hurdles, whence the crookmen man&oelig;uvre the
struggling, gasping sheep in the water below.&nbsp; At one end of
the creek is the plunge, where the sheep are thrown in; midway
down the wash two tubs are sunk to within a foot of the
water&rsquo;s level, wherein stand the washers; and at the far
end appears a gradually rising slope up which the dripping,
water-logged ewes struggle inch by inch towards safety and the
green feed awaiting them beyond.</p>
<p>It is nearing the top of the tide, but the work has not begun
yet, nor will it begin until the flock has rested and cooled from
its long journey over the Downs.&nbsp; As I come down the zigzag
path into the chalk-quarry, the place seems almost as shy and
still as ever.&nbsp; There is the multitude of sheep, a thousand
or more, quietly nibbling in the great pen.&nbsp; The shepherds,
the washing-gang, the little crowd of onlookers, are lounging on
the green river-bank, chatting idly together as if there were no
more weighty business in hand than to enjoy the summer
morning.&nbsp; The dogs are mostly asleep on their chains.&nbsp;
Only the old captain of the wash is astir.&nbsp; He roves about,
here tightening up a girth in his tackle, <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>and there
straightening a crooked hurdle; and every minute or two he goes
and looks over the plunge, measuring the depth of water with his
eye.&nbsp; At last he gives the signal, every man goes to his
post, and the silence of the old quarry breaks as with the crash
of a sudden storm.</p>
<p>For it is nearly impossible to convey a real idea of the
hubbub and turmoil of the scene under any less decided
simile.&nbsp; From the moment the first sheep is thrown in, until
the last terrified, bedraggled ewe staggers up the slippery
incline at the other end of the creek, there is one long,
unceasing babel of sound.&nbsp; Often a score of sheep are in the
water at the same time, each one rending the air with her piteous
calling.&nbsp; Those that have passed through the ordeal crowd
together on the bank above, still lifting to the skies their
mingled note of indignation and alarm; and those as yet dry in
the great pen anticipate their sufferings with a like deafening
tumult.&nbsp; The yapping chorus of the dogs punctuates the
entire symphony; and every man engaged in the work joins in a
general running fire of comment and mutual encouragement,
although hardly any sound less forceful than the bellow of a bull
can be heard above the din.</p>
<p>Not the least onerous and responsible part in a great
sheep-wash is the element of danger to the sheep&mdash;the risk
of drowning always present <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>when a large number have to be put
through the creek at a swinging pace.&nbsp; The head shepherd,
and often the flock-master himself, stands at the plunge and
keeps a vigilant eye on the whole proceedings.&nbsp; Yet, even
with the greatest care, sheep are sometimes drowned.&nbsp; It is
a lucky day, for washers and shepherds alike, if the flock gets
back to the farm without a single casualty.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>But there is a humorous as well as a tragic side to
sheep-washing.&nbsp; The continual splashing of the water soon
drenches all the approaches to the creek, making them as slippery
as ice.&nbsp; The platform of hurdles running the whole length of
the wash is a particularly hazardous place from which to look on
at the fun; and many a spectator, venturing too near, has
received an impromptu ducking.&nbsp; This is an accident to which
the throwers-in, as well as all the crook-men, are specially
liable; and the day is hardly complete unless some one has
succeeded in dipping himself as well as the sheep.&nbsp; The
time-honoured joke then is to force him down the creek with his
woolly companions in misfortune, and send him under the bar with
all the rest.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>For days past now the rain has been steadily falling, hour
after hour, from dark to dark.&nbsp; <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Rain and wind together are always
disconcerting, and often melancholy in the last degree; but
still, soft summer rain like this, not heavy enough to obscure an
outlook, yet sufficient to serve as an excuse for stopping
indoors, has all sorts of commendable qualities.&nbsp; Much of
the time, both in daylight and darkness, I have spent lolling out
of a little dormer-window high up in the roof of this old house,
and I have got to know many small things about life and work in
Windlecombe that I have never known before.</p>
<p>It would seem that the cat and I are almost the only
able-bodied creatures, feathered, four-footed, or human, that are
not out and about in the rain, and I alone because the indoor
mood happens to possess me.&nbsp; If I shed that craze before the
weeping weather is done, I may be squelching about with the rest
all day long in the sodden lanes; or slithering joyfully over the
green turf of the Downs miles away, barefoot and bareheaded,
absent-mindedly whistling the first halves of innumerable tunes
as I go.&nbsp; But of that in its season.&nbsp; The cat and I are
of a mind now.&nbsp; The comforts of a dry coat appeal to each of
us for the moment irresistibly; and we lean out over the
window-sill no farther than will afford me a view of the village
doings, and her an eye-feast on the martins chattering about the
roof-eaves below.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>I saw
Farmer Coles go by in his gig to-day, and heard him call out to
his bailiff on the footway, &lsquo;If &rsquo;tis fine, George,
i&rsquo; th&rsquo; marnin&rsquo;, get all th&rsquo; tackle down
to th&rsquo; Hoe-field, an&rsquo; make a start first
thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; The word brought my heart into my
mouth.&nbsp; The Hoe-field is the field where the first wild rose
opened to the spell of the nightingale&rsquo;s music; and it
meant that haying-time had come round at last.&nbsp; To-morrow
there might be a new sound in Windlecombe, the high ringing note
of the mowing-machines; and I knew then there would be no hour of
daylight free from it, until the last meadow lay shorn and
desolate under the summer sun.</p>
<p>In modern village life, the lot of the sentimentalist is no
easy one, especially if he love his neighbour.&nbsp; Though he
may secretly repine for the old days, when the grass came down to
the rhythmic song of the scythe, and the corn to the tune of the
sickle, he cannot blink the fact that, in farm life, prosperity
and machinery go hand-in-hand together.&nbsp; The true, indeed
the only, way for him now is to realise that not all the beauty
of country things belongs to old times, and not all the hard,
ugly utilitarianism of nowadays has come in with machinery.&nbsp;
Honestly considered, there is no mechanical farm-implement of
to-day essentially at variance with the spirit of beauty.&nbsp; A
threshing-mill or a <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>reaper-and-binder owes its form and
parts to the same designer that made the sickle.&nbsp; The lines
of a sailing-ship are unvaryingly lines of grace, because they
are dictated by wind and water.&nbsp; And the unchanging needs of
earth that made sickle, scythe, and ploughshare what they are,
are as unchanging and imperious as ever.</p>
<p>It was hard to conceive the nightingale&rsquo;s song without
the loveliness of the mowing-grass&mdash;the green dragon-flies
cruising over its sea of blossom, the shadows of the
swallows&rsquo; wings upon it, and the grumbling bees like
pearl-divers at fault down in its emerald depths.&nbsp; But now,
listening to the songs of the birds in the village gardens round
about, songs that seemed all the more joyous for the grey light
and the unceasing patter of the rain, the truth fell cold upon me
that the nightingale&rsquo;s was no longer among them.&nbsp; But
a few days past, she was keening as sorrowfully as ever.&nbsp; In
the one glimpse of soused moonshine last night I had thought to
hear her plaint far down by the river; but I could not be sure of
it, and the sound had not returned.&nbsp; Maybe her song is done
at last, and I could wish it so, now that the grass is to
fall.</p>
<p>With a little neck-craning, I can contrive a view of the
Reverend&rsquo;s garden, or as much of it as is discernible
through the crowding trees.&nbsp; On the smooth fair lawn I can
see his white doves <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>strutting, but they are there alone
to-day.&nbsp; Generally, when I look forth, there is the gaunt
black figure pacing to and fro, with these snow-white atoms
fluttering about its feet.&nbsp; At the end of the lawn an arm
goes out, and the figure pulls up at the first touch on the
rose-covered trellis.&nbsp; There is the bank of mignonette at
the other end, and here he halts and turns, warned by the music
of the bees.&nbsp; But I have never been able to guess what
guides him unerringly between the rippled edges of the
flower-beds; nor why, when walking under the wall, hung from end
to end with blue racemes of wistaria, he goes no farther each way
than the limit of the blossoms&rsquo; reach.&nbsp; The gleaming
white turrets of syringa, of acacia, of guelder rose, these I
know are just visible to him; and his doves lighten the darkness
a little about his feet.&nbsp; But there are whole stretches of
the garden given over to deep-hued things&mdash;rhododendrons and
peonies, canterbury-bells and flaming tiger-lilies; amidst these
he must pass with eyes as little aware of their passionate colour
as I of the tiger-moth&rsquo;s scarlet when he burrs in my ear at
night.&nbsp; Yet is glowing colour of a truth a thing that
reaches us through one sense alone?&nbsp; I have doubted it ever
since&mdash;</p>
<p>An angry shout struck up to me just now from a side alley
below the green, where some of the <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>poorest and prettiest of the
cottages are jumbled together.&nbsp; It is strange how far sounds
carry on these still, rainy mornings.&nbsp; The shout was
followed by the shrill tones of a woman, and the thud of
something being hurled into the street.&nbsp; Presently, through
the alley-mouth, appeared a man with a basket on his back.&nbsp;
He came up the street through the rain, bent and lurching, his
black beard wagging with imprecations he was at no pains to
subdue.&nbsp; It was Darkie, the tramp, fern-seller,
ne&rsquo;er-do-well; a familiar figure in Windlecombe.&nbsp; As
usual, he was pretty far gone in liquor.&nbsp; He took the middle
of the way, addressing himself to all passers-by
indiscriminately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wimmin,&rsquo; he cried, in his fine deep voice with
the violoncello quality in it, &lsquo;wimmin? ye may live
&rsquo;til crack o&rsquo; Doom, sir, and then never larn how to
take &rsquo;em!&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; two!&rdquo; sez
she, only laast Saddaday, ma&rsquo;am, &ldquo;an&rsquo; bring
another brace, Darkie,&rdquo; she sez, &ldquo;when ye happens
along agen,&rdquo;&mdash;all as nice as nice could be, sir.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; now, soon as &rsquo;a sot eyes o&rsquo; me, &rsquo;a
hups wir futt, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned the corner of the house, and I heard no more.</p>
<p>I wonder, now, how Darkie fares this weather in his Downland
eyrie.&nbsp; It has always been a mystery in Windlecombe as to
where he passes <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>his nights.&nbsp; At all times, winter or summer, he is
to be met with, tramping up the lane towards the Downs; using the
last light of day apparently in putting himself as far as may be
from the chance of a night&rsquo;s lodging; and, in the early
mornings, you meet him trudging down again from the heights, his
basket full of odd hedgeside garnerings for sale in the
town.&nbsp; The mystery is a mystery to me no longer, although it
was quite by chance I lit upon him in his secret nook.</p>
<p>Coming over the Downs one winter&rsquo;s morning, I saw a thin
blue spiral of smoke rising from the very centre of a great patch
of gorse on a hill-side; and threading my way through the
wilderness, bent on elucidating this phenomenon, I came at length
upon a queer little scene.&nbsp; At the mouth of a sort of cave
cut deep into the solid green heart of the gorse thicket, burned
a little fire of sticks; and over it hung a pot that gave forth a
savoury steam.&nbsp; Behind the fire lay Darkie on a snug couch
of hay and old sacking, fast asleep, with a pipe in his
mouth.&nbsp; Evidently he had dozed off in the midst of his
preparations for a meal.&nbsp; I took one swift look round his
castle, noting various old tins, old coats, and the like hanging
over his head; several sugar-boxes filled with odd lumber behind
him; and a shepherd&rsquo;s folding-bar&mdash;a deadly weapon,
twenty pounds or so of solid iron&mdash;lying conveniently <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>to his
hand; and then I crept away, as silently as I had come.&nbsp; Not
that I feared any violence from him.&nbsp; In all the years we
had been acquainted, I had never known him harm a mouse.&nbsp;
But many was the time I had turned him away from my own door,
unceremoniously enough; sometimes with hard words, once or twice,
indeed, with threatenings of his natural enemy, the
constable.&nbsp; And I feared now reprisals of a kind that would
hurt almost as much as the folding-bar heftily wielded&mdash;I
feared to see Darkie stagger to his feet and pull off to me one
of my own long-discarded caps, hear him give me generous and
courtly words of welcome, and a kind look out of his
mastiff&rsquo;s eyes, making me as free of his snug, green-roofed
dwelling as I had so often made him free of the street.</p>
<p>Towards the hour of sunset I went up to the little attic
window again, and looked out over the drenched housetops for any
sign of a break in the weather.&nbsp; The rain had ceased, and
the western sky had lightened somewhat, taking on an indefinable
warmth of hue.&nbsp; There was no sunshine, nor any hope of
sunshine; but there was a light abroad that picked out all the
browns and reds and yellows in the landscape, wondrously
intensifying them, while leaving all other hues as grey and cold
as ever.</p>
<p>Past eleven o&rsquo;clock, and a cloudless night of <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>stars, with
the wood-larks singing high over the village, and the cuckoos
calling in the hills as though it were broad day.&nbsp;
Yes&mdash;the change has come: Farmer Coles is never far out in
his prognostications.&nbsp; It will be cutting weather to-morrow;
and to-morrow I must be up with the earliest of them, and away to
the Hoe-field.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>Of summer evenings in Windlecombe, all through haying and
harvest time, you see men lounging about the village, one and all
obsessed by the same trance-like, serenely dilatory mood.&nbsp;
All have pipes well alight, leaving a trail of smoke behind them
on the dusky golden air.&nbsp; All have hands thrust deep in
trouser-pockets, carry their unshaven chins high, are tired as
dogs, and look as somnolently happy as noontide owls.&nbsp; And
of all the days of the week, there are more of these placid
optimists abroad, and these characteristics are most to be noted
in them, on the evening of the last working day.</p>
<p>To-night I went up and down the green&mdash;the most uncertain
of a deliberately irresolute company&mdash;half a dozen times,
perhaps, before, by common but unvoiced consent, we turned our
lagging footsteps towards the inn.&nbsp; All the while <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>I was
rejoicing in a possession, priceless indeed, yet hard-won as
might be&mdash;a heart and mind filled with the spirit of the
<i>Cottar&rsquo;s Saturday Night</i>.&nbsp; You cannot get this
chief of all country pleasures in exchange for money.&nbsp; It is
to be had in only one way, at the cost of long laborious days in
the fields; and every tired muscle, every aching joint in my
body, stood then as witness that I had done my best to earn what
I had of it, if it might be earned at all.&nbsp; The old oak
window-seat, in the parlour of the Three Thatchers, was as softly
welcome as the Chancellor&rsquo;s woolsack: I would not have
exchanged that mug of home-brewed ale for a draught of ambrosia
at the feet of the gods.</p>
<p>The crimson sunset light streamed hot upon me, as I sat on the
window-ledge half among the parlour company, and half among those
congregated on the benches under the virginia creeper
outside.&nbsp; Every moment or two some other tired haymaker
strolled up, and added his solid breadth and his tobacco smoke to
the throng.&nbsp; But we were not all field-workers in the Three
Thatchers to-night, nor had only the common causes of tired limbs
and sun-parched throats brought us together.&nbsp; Young Daniel
Dray was knitting his dark brows over some papers and
account-books at the trestle-table; and young Tom Clemmer sat
close by, <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>thoughtfully swinging a cricket-bat pendulum-fashion
between his outstretched legs.&nbsp; A silence fell upon the
company.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Tom Clemmer at last, &lsquo;I
dunno.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis ne&rsquo;ersome-matter awk&rsquo;ard fer
Windlecombe.&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; young Maast&rsquo; Coles
hayin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; Tim Searle hayin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; George
Locker, an&rsquo; Tom an&rsquo; George Wright, an&rsquo; Bill
here all hayin&rsquo;, how i&rsquo; fortun&rsquo; be us to make
up a team?&rsquo;</p>
<p>You could pick out the members of the cricket-club committee
amidst the crowd by reason of their grave, troubled faces;
whereas all other faces wore the easy contented smile of the
village Saturday night.&nbsp; We had weighty business to
consider.&nbsp; The annual challenge had arrived from the
Stavisham club.&nbsp; They were a cocksure, overweening lot, the
town-eleven; and we had set our hearts on beating them at next
Saturday&rsquo;s match.&nbsp; But there was the hay to carry, if
the weather held.&nbsp; Many of our best players would be in the
fields.&nbsp; It looked as though the town were to add
Windlecombe again to their long list of village victories.&nbsp;
Secretary Dray gnawed savagely at the butt of his pen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knows how &rsquo;twill be,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Five men an&rsquo; a tail o&rsquo; boys&mdash;the ould
story!&nbsp; Tom here &rsquo;ull knock up his couple o&rsquo;
score; and then &rsquo;twill be hout, hout, hout, fer th&rsquo;
rest o&rsquo; us i&rsquo; two <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>hovers.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I can jest
hear they chalk-headed town chaps larfin&rsquo;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a dismal picture.&nbsp; The fragrance went out of our
tobacco, and no man thought of his ale.&nbsp; The three canaries
carolled so joyously in their cages overhead, that I could have
wrung their necks with all the pleasure in life.&nbsp; Young
Daniel stared straight into the eye of the setting sun with the
very face of disaster.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But &rsquo;tis th&rsquo; bawlin&rsquo;,&rsquo; he went
on.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ne&rsquo;er a change o&rsquo; bawlers,
there&rsquo;ll be; an&rsquo; me an&rsquo; George Havers
caan&rsquo;t go on fer ever.&nbsp; Na, na! &rsquo;tis all over
agen, I tell ye!&nbsp; The boys ull ha&rsquo; their fun,
an&rsquo; Windlecombe another smashin&rsquo;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He swept the club papers into his pocket, and rose to fill a
pipe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But mind ye!&rsquo; he added, looking grimly round on
the company, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; that there flitter-mouse
grocer-chap&rsquo;s wicket this time, or I&rsquo;ll
be&mdash;&nbsp; Ah! you see if I doan&rsquo;t, if I ha&rsquo; to
throw at his &rsquo;ed!&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Long after night had fallen, and all the village was quiet
under the dim half-moon, I came out again upon the green, to
wander and ruminate over the week that had gone by.&nbsp; I bared
my arm to the biceps, and even in that disguising light I could
see the sunburn dark upon it.&nbsp; Yawning and stretching
involuntarily, a delicious <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>ache spread over me from top to
toe.&nbsp; The Seven Sisters loomed hard by, and I went and lay
down at full length on one of the seats, looking up through the
black wilderness of boughs at the flinching starshine, and
watching the nightjars as they wheeled and whirred above me
through the scented dark.</p>
<p>They are a merry company, the nightjars.&nbsp; Perhaps there
is no other sound in Nature that comes nearer to pure mirth and
jollity than this rhythmic, spinning-wheel chorus of
theirs.&nbsp; Up there, where the dense pine foliage made a sort
of black coast to the dark blue ocean of the summer night, a
whole nation of them was astir.&nbsp; They did not utter their
peculiar note when on the wing; but every moment or two one of
the concourse came to rest on a branch with a sudden snap, and
forthwith set his spinning-jenny blithely going.</p>
<p>There is another sound which you hear of summer evenings,
often far into the night, and which is nearly akin to that of the
nightjar.&nbsp; I heard it only a minute ago in one of the garden
hedges as I came across the green.&nbsp; But when the two songs
occur together, there is no confusing them.&nbsp; They are both
continuous, mechanical sounds, and each is curiously varied in
tone, speed, and intensity.&nbsp; But while the nightjar&rsquo;s
music is a rich full tremolo, uttered from some <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>high point,
generally the branch of a tree, the grasshopper-warbler sings
always close to earth.&nbsp; His note is thinner, shriller,
faster.&nbsp; If your fingers were as deft as his slender throat,
you could imitate the sound exactly by the rapid chinking
together of two threepenny-bits.</p>

161</span>JULY</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the spring of the year, July
seems as far off as middle-age seems to youth, and almost as
undesirable.&nbsp; But when midsummer-day is past and gone,
whether in human life or the year&rsquo;s progress, we look at
things with clearer, more widely ranging eyes.&nbsp; The man in
his prime strength, the season at the summit of its
beauty&mdash;these are fairer things than the childhood and the
springtime that have gone to make them.&nbsp; For the greater
must be all the greater and more wonderful, because it contains
the wondrous less.</p>
<p>Here is the first day of July come, and ever since sunrise I
have been straying about the field-paths and lanes, wending home,
indeed, only when the fierce noontide heat and a ravening hunger
combined to drive me thither.&nbsp; There was this fierce, tropic
quality in the sunlight from the very first.&nbsp; Though the
gilt arrow on the church dial pointed barely to four
o&rsquo;clock, the level sunbeams struck hot and bright on the <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>face; and
the dew in the grass by the laneside was shrinking visibly with
every moment.&nbsp; In an hour the last water-bell was gone from
the shadiest nook in the wood.&nbsp; Only the teasels could defy
the thirsty sun, and these kept their water-traps over-brimming,
as if fed from a magic source, far into the heat of the day.</p>
<p>There are many common things of the country-side&mdash;small
facts to be learned for the trouble of a glance&mdash;which are
little known because the glance is seldom given.&nbsp; As I
passed along the hedge where the teasels stood up straight as a
row of church spires, the glitter of the water in their leaf-cups
caught my eye, and I stopped to look at them.&nbsp; I had always
thought of the teasels as natural drinking-places for the bees,
and other flying or creeping things; but now I saw that their use
was very different.&nbsp; Studying the plant carefully, the whole
meaning of the thing dawned on me at last.&nbsp; The teasel must
be a flesh-eater, more greedy and destructive than any spider in
the land.&nbsp; In the cups a host of creatures lay drowned; and
upon the green, translucent leaves and stems there crawled
multitudes of others, all destined for the same fate.&nbsp; There
were in the water not only small insects, but bumble-bees, large
caterpillars and slugs, even broad-winged night-moths that had
fallen to the teasel&rsquo;s snare.&nbsp; I saw also that the <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>pools of
water insulating every stem served not as traps alone, but
actually as digestive cells, wherein the carcases of the
teasel&rsquo;s prey were gradually resolved into the slime that
lay at the bottom of each cup.&nbsp; Somehow, I conjectured, this
must be absorbed into the tissue of the plant; and cutting one of
the stems asunder, just where the water-holding leaves embraced
it, I came upon what seemed proof of this&mdash;a ring of
apertures at the base of each cup&mdash;sink holes, in
fact&mdash;leading into the substance of the stem.</p>
<p>The path wound up a hill-side over a field of tares, rippling
away before me through the sea of purple blossom until it ended
abruptly against the blue sky far above.&nbsp; And here another
minute wonder brought me to a halt.&nbsp; Though it was so early,
the hive-bees were out and about in their thousands.&nbsp; The
great field was besieged by them.&nbsp; The air throbbed with
their music.&nbsp; A madness for honey-making seemed upon them
all; and yet, of all the busy thousands upon thousands set loose
amidst what seemed illimitable forage-ground, nowhere could I see
a hive-bee upon a flower.&nbsp; I went down on hands and knees
for a closer view, believing at first that my eyes were playing
false with me.&nbsp; But there was no doubt about it.&nbsp;
Though on every side the great furry bumble-bees were seizing
upon, and <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>dragging open the purple blooms of the tares, the
hive-bees never touched these, for all they were in so huge a
heat and flurry of work.</p>
<p>Now I knew that, while every other insect under heaven has its
times of relaxation, deeming moments given over to dancing in a
sunbeam or basking on a wall as moments not ill-spent, the
honey-bee allows herself no such wasteful delights.&nbsp; If she
were here in this tare-field in her thousands, and here she was,
she came for no other purpose than a useful one.&nbsp; Clearly,
therefore, the hive-bees were getting nectar in abundance: yet
how, if they were not seeking it in the flowers?</p>
<p>Another minute&rsquo;s careful watch resolved the
mystery.&nbsp; The tare-plant can almost rank with the
slug-devouring teasel as a curiosity of the country-side.&nbsp;
Knowing well that the hive-bee&rsquo;s tongue is not long enough
to reach the sweets at the bottom of its flower-cup, the tare
provides a special feast outside.&nbsp; At the base of each
leaf-and flower-stalk, just where these join on to the main stem,
will be found a little green flap or fin.&nbsp; In the centre of
this fin is a valve, from which exudes a thick sweet
liquid.&nbsp; If you are quicker than the bee, you may see the
tiny globule shining in the sun as you turn the plant up.&nbsp;
But even as you look, a bee fusses in between your fingers,
drinks up the liquid in a <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>moment, and hums off to the next
stalk.&nbsp; If we can extend no more sympathy to the bee in her
folly of never-ending labours than to a lily-of-the-field at
toil, we must at least concede something for her
fearlessness.&nbsp; A peep into her own looking-glass is not
always all of virtue&rsquo;s reward.</p>
<p>Over the field of purple tares, and on through the
cornfields&mdash;wheat waving high and green, with the scarlet
poppies flushing midway down in its murmuring depths.&nbsp; Who
would have hawthorn and buttercups, the bridal white and gold of
spring, when he can have poppies by the million, and roses, a
wagon-load to be gathered from every hedgerow, if he will?&nbsp;
Where I stood, breast-high in the wheat-field, the poppies
crowded thick together among the green stems, making one unbroken
sheet of colour that I could hardly look upon in the full light
of the summer sun.&nbsp; A little way onward, and this blood-red
flare was softened instantly: a dozen yards away there was
nothing but the rustling green of the wheat.&nbsp; Every moment a
lark rose out of the corn, singing, or dropped into it like a
stone silently out of the blue.&nbsp; The hedgerow on the far
side of the field shone with the roses, tremulous, uncertain, in
the heated air.&nbsp; Beyond, in the blue mist of woodlands, a
blackbird chanted his joy of the morning; and all round me in the
distant ring of hills, there were cuckoos <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>chiming,
each note clear but double, some of the songs perfect still.</p>
<p>From the wheat, the path led me presently into the oat-fields,
green too, but of a cooler, greyer tinge; and full of a stealthy
motion and the sound of wind, though scarce a breath was moving
overhead.&nbsp; There is something eerie, mysterious, about a
field of oats on a hot summer&rsquo;s morning.&nbsp; It is as
though the ears bent together and whispered to each other,
passing the word on unceasingly from plant to plant.&nbsp;
Looking over the plane of grey-green awns, stretching away under
the still sunshine, you see low wavelets rise and fall, furrows
come and go; the light changes; or, suddenly, the whole expanse
grows mute and still.&nbsp; A gentle, inconstant breeze would
produce exactly this effect; but you see it when not a leaf moves
in the highest treetops, when even the aspens have hushed their
quivering music under the noontide glare.&nbsp; No doubt, in a
minor degree, all plants show this movement, whether it be caused
by the travelling heat of the sun, or be simply due to the
varying impetus of growth.&nbsp; In a great field of corn closely
drilled, there are always the separate individualities of the
plants comprising it to be reckoned with.&nbsp; That these exist
in fact, as well as in fancy, is difficult to demonstrate.&nbsp;
But that each field has a communal spirit&mdash;often different
<a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>from, or
wholly antagonistic to, that of its near neighbour&mdash;is
evident.&nbsp; For how else to explain why all the ears of corn
in one field lean eastward, and all the ears in the next field
may incline normally to the west?</p>
<p>Coming homeward at last, surfeited of sunshine, eyes and ears
outwearied with the brilliance and the melody of the day, I
stopped awhile in the shadow of the church tower to consider an
old familiar, yet perennially interesting thing.&nbsp; Just as I,
at fiercest noon, was returning to the shelter of my own cool,
ivy-mantled nest, the swifts that built in the tower were lancing
back to their homes in the gloom of the belfry.&nbsp; Singly, in
twos and threes together, every moment saw them arriving and
disappearing through the jalousies; but now none went forth
again, though they had been coming and going all the morning
long.&nbsp; There they would remain, I knew, quiet in the
temperate dark of the old tower, until the sun had got out of its
furnace-like mood.&nbsp; And then they would be out and about
again, yet filled with a wholly different spirit.&nbsp; And
towards sunset they would be tearing round the sky in a madcap
chevy-chase, screaming like black imps let out of Inferno.</p>

168</span>II</h3>
<p>Windlecombe Mead, where the village cricket matches have been
played from time immemorial, lies on the gently sloping ground
between Arun river and the hills.&nbsp; It was the day of the
great annual match with Stavisham, and most of the older
villagers had congregated on the benches round the scoring-tent,
when, in the sweltering heat of early afternoon, I hurried down
to the field with pencil and book.&nbsp; The townsmen, it seemed,
had won the toss, and had elected to put the home-team in.&nbsp;
Young Tom Clemmer and young Daniel Dray were already at the
wickets, taking middle.&nbsp; I looked round at the glum, set
faces of the spectators, and felt tragedy in the air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fower men an&rsquo; a parson,&rsquo; whispered the old
cobbler to me behind his hand, &rsquo;a ould rickety chap as
caan&rsquo;t run, an&rsquo; five bits o&rsquo; lads!&nbsp; Drat
that there hay!&nbsp; Heough!&nbsp; Now they&rsquo;re
aff!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The umpire had called Play.&nbsp; The fast Stavisham
bowler&mdash;we knew him of old&mdash;retired into open country,
wheeled, and bore down on the crease like a bull at a gate.&nbsp;
Young Daniel ducked, then turned up a face of indignant
scarlet.&nbsp; But the ball had gone by for two, and a chuckle of
relief spread through the crowd.&nbsp; The bowler prepared to try
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dan&rsquo;l&rsquo;s got th&rsquo; sun in &rsquo;s
eyes,&rsquo; said old Dray <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>anxiously, as he watched.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;A never can bide that top wicket!&nbsp; Steady now,
Dannie, an&rsquo; keep a straight bat!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He roared out the last words.&nbsp; And then, in a moment, we
were all on our feet in consternation.&nbsp; The ball had never
left the bowler&rsquo;s hand&mdash;that much we were sure
of.&nbsp; Daniel stood at his wicket safe and sound, but Tom
Clemmer was coming back to the tent, followed by a derisive
chorus from the whole field.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hout, Tom?&nbsp; Never hout!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What i&rsquo; th&rsquo; wureld houted ye,
lad?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hout!&nbsp; Never!&mdash;&rsquo;tis a swindle,
Tom!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Amidst the eager exclamations of his friends, Tom Clemmer
strode into the tent, and began slowly to unbuckle his
pads.&nbsp; All the time he stared fixedly into space.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could ha&rsquo; hup wi&rsquo; my fist,&rsquo; he
said, after a moment&rsquo;s wrathful silence, addressing no one
in particular, &rsquo;an&rsquo; I could ha&rsquo; gi&rsquo;en
that there grocer-chap sech a&mdash;&nbsp; But there! &rsquo;tis
no sense yammerin&rsquo;!&nbsp; Doan&rsquo;t ye run out, sir, or
&rsquo;a &rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; ye, same as &rsquo;a had
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke now to the curate, who was preparing to go to the
wicket, and the truth dawned upon us at last.&nbsp; The bowler
had played Tom a very ancient and very mean-spirited trick.&nbsp;
Old Clemmer, regardless of the agony it caused him, stamped his
swaddled foot upon the ground.</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>&lsquo;An&rsquo; to think, Tom!&rsquo; he groaned,
&lsquo;as ye lit up th&rsquo; forge-fire special for &rsquo;un
only laast Sunday, &rsquo;cause his ould mare&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>But we had no thought for anything but the disaster that had
befallen us, and all that was now imminent.&nbsp; With Tom
Clemmer, the one hope of Windlecombe, out of the fight, what
might happen to the rest?&nbsp; With bated breath we watched for
the third ball.&nbsp; Young Daniel drove it over the
bowler&rsquo;s head, and with a trembling pencil I put down two
to his name.&nbsp; Playing with desperate care, he added two more
before the end of the over, and we began to pluck up heart
again.&nbsp; Young Tom came and stood behind me.&nbsp; His big
thumb travelled down the list of names on the scoring-book.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis not lost yet!&rsquo; he said with reviving
cheerfulness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dan&rsquo;l may do well, wanst
&rsquo;a gets set.&nbsp; An&rsquo; belike Mr. Weaverly &rsquo;ull
bide out a bit.&nbsp; Then there be Huggins wi&rsquo; his luck;
an&rsquo; who knaws but what the boys &rsquo;ull account fer a
dozen or so atween &rsquo;em?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had now time, as the fielders were accommodating themselves
to the left-handed batting of the curate, to glance down the
list.&nbsp; The last name came upon me as an utter surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&nbsp; Never old Stallwood!&nbsp; Why, he must be
seventy, if he&rsquo;s a&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay!&nbsp; Cap&rsquo;n Stall&rsquo;ard sure enow!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a joke, <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>more &rsquo;n anything.&nbsp; But ne&rsquo;er another
livin&rsquo; sowl there wur, as cud&mdash;&nbsp; Oh,
Jupitty!&nbsp; Mr. Weaverly&rsquo;s hout leg-afore!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But it was not Mr. Weaverly&rsquo;s leg.&nbsp; With a white
face, his body bent to the shape of an inverted letter L, and
both arms clasped about his middle, the curate came tip-toeing
back to the tent.&nbsp; He sat down silently in a corner.&nbsp;
Huggins&mdash;a lean, red-whiskered giant in
moleskins&mdash;burst out into the sunshine and made for the
wicket, waving his bat like a war-club and murmuring imprecations
as he went.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now &rsquo;tis jest touch-an&rsquo;-go,&rsquo; said
young Tom in my ear.&nbsp; &lsquo;If &rsquo;a hits &rsquo;em,
they&rsquo;ll travel, you mark me!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be eether
th&rsquo; river, th&rsquo; town, or Windle Hill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Huggins stood at the wicket, legs wide apart, and bat held
high over his head.&nbsp; The bowling now was swift, stealthy,
underhand.&nbsp; The ball sped down the pitch, never leaving the
grass for an inch.&nbsp; A crack rang out in the dazzling July
sunshine.&nbsp; Daniel Dray started to run, but the batsman waved
him back.&nbsp; Huggins stood watching the skied ball until it
came to ground in the next field.&nbsp; He laughed
uproariously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What d&rsquo;ye think o&rsquo; ee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was another four, and that made eleven in all.&nbsp;
Huggins swung up his bat, and spread his great <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>hob-nailed
boots for a still mightier effort.&nbsp; The ball hissed down the
pitch.&nbsp; Huggins caught it as it hopped from a tussock.&nbsp;
Like a lark it soared up into the blue, and we heard a clear
musical plunk as it dropped into the river.&nbsp; A roar of
delight burst from the crowd.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lost ball!&rsquo; shouted Tom behind me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hooroar!&nbsp; Seventeen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Huggins spat upon his hands, took a reef in his leather belt,
and lifted his bat again.&nbsp; The little underhand bowler came
crouching up to the crease, and launched the new ball almost from
his knees.&nbsp; Wide and wild it flew this time.&nbsp; But there
was a sound of crashing timber; Huggins&rsquo;s wicket scattered
into space, stumps and bails whirling together half-way up the
pitch.&nbsp; He had hit the wrong thing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An&rsquo; now,&rsquo; wailed poor Tom Clemmer,
&lsquo;&rsquo;tis as good as finished.&nbsp; Dan&rsquo;l wunt
ha&rsquo; no chaance.&nbsp; Jest as well declare, an&rsquo;
ha&rsquo; done wi&rsquo; it.&nbsp; Th&rsquo;
boys?&mdash;they&rsquo;ll be all done in a hover,
an&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, an&rsquo; what about th&rsquo; Cap&rsquo;n,
Tom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was the voice of the Captain himself, and we all turned to
look.&nbsp; He was leaning comfortably against the tent pole, the
very picture of an old, superannuated forecastle-hand.&nbsp; He
wore his usual vast faded blue suit.&nbsp; A seaman&rsquo;s cap
with hard shiny peak gripped his bald head from the rear.&nbsp;
His red face swam in joviality and <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>perspiration.&nbsp; Tom regarded him
with mingled respect and doubt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye caan&rsquo;t run, Maast&rsquo;
Stall&rsquo;ard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trew, Tom!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An&rsquo; ye ha&rsquo;ant touched a crickut bat fer
thirty year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trew agen,&rsquo; returned the Captain serenely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha, hum! well! a good plucked-un ye be, anyways.&nbsp;
Now then, Dickie!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The first small boy set forth over the sunny stretch of grass
that lay between the tent and the waiting team.&nbsp; Very small
and insignificant he looked in his school-corduroys, and leg-pads
that reached well-nigh up to his waist.&nbsp; His advent was
greeted with ribaldry from all parts of the field.&nbsp; We heard
Daniel Dray admonishing the boy as he came smiling up to the
pitch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Dickie, doan&rsquo;t ye dare run &rsquo;til I
shouts to ye, an&rsquo; then run as if <i>He</i> wur after
ye.&nbsp; Hould your bat straight, ye young varmint!&nbsp; Now
then, look hout!&nbsp; There! what did I tell ye?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dickie&rsquo;s wicket was down, and Dickie himself was running
back to the tent vastly relieved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out wi&rsquo; ye, Georgie Huggins!&nbsp; An&rsquo; do
as well as your faather!&rsquo; cried Tom Clemmer
encouragingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis hover, an&rsquo;
Dan&rsquo;l&rsquo;s got th&rsquo; play now.&nbsp; Oh,
Dan&rsquo;l, Dan&rsquo;l! if only &rsquo;twur you an&rsquo;
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, playing with the ingenuity as well as the <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>courage of
despair, young Daniel Dray now began to show his true
mettle.&nbsp; Odd runs he refused, taking only even numbers, so
that each time the bowling fell to his lot again.&nbsp; At the
end of the over, he stole a desperate single with the same object
in view.&nbsp; He reached home safe enough, but Georgie was run
out.&nbsp; Boy Number Two had been disposed of at the cost of a
gallant six.</p>
<p>Following the same tactics, young Daniel eked out the
remaining three boys with still more crafty skill.&nbsp; When at
length old Stallwood, the last man, launched out into the
sunlight to show the town what he remembered of cricket, the
score had risen to forty-nine, and our spirits with it.&nbsp; We
cheered him lustily as he went.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wan more,&rsquo; quoth Tom Clemmer, &lsquo;jest wan,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll light me pipe.&nbsp; There be allers a
chaance wi&rsquo; fifty.&nbsp; Lorsh!&nbsp; Look at th&rsquo;
Cap&rsquo;n!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Three times on his way to the pitch he had stopped, turned,
and waved his cap in acknowledgment of the ovation given
him.&nbsp; And now he was greeting the Stavishamites each by
name, and shaking hands with the wicket-keeper.&nbsp; He got to
the crease at last and grounded his bat.&nbsp; The next moment
the whole field had left their places and run for the tent,
leaving the Captain standing alone and amazed at his wicket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;A doan&rsquo;t knaw &rsquo;a be hout,&rsquo;
said Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;D&rsquo; ye <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>onnerstand?&nbsp; &rsquo;A never
heerd th&rsquo; bawler shout, an&rsquo; never seed th&rsquo; ball
acomin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Belike &rsquo;a thinks they be all gone fer
a drink, to hearten &rsquo;em at the sight o&rsquo; sech a
crickutter!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And being free for a time, I took upon myself the task of
walking out to the Captain, and breaking the news to him as
gently as I could.</p>
<p>It was now Windlecombe&rsquo;s turn to take the field, and Tom
Clemmer led out his team with a good heart, in spite of its tail
of juveniles.&nbsp; Daniel Dray and the Rev. Mr. Weaverly were
our first, indeed our only bowlers.&nbsp; One of the first
batsmen for Stavisham was Daniel&rsquo;s ancient foe, the grocer;
and we watched the beginning of play with breathless interest,
for we knew Daniel would aim to kill.&nbsp; He grubbed savagely
in the sawdust, then sent the first ball hurtling down the
pitch.</p>
<p>The old men were still upon the benches outside, and in that
quarter sympathy with Windlecombe was as staunch as ever.&nbsp;
But in the scoring tent I sat amidst enemies now.&nbsp; The
townsmen crowded behind me, a humorously sarcastic crew.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fifty to beat?&nbsp; My ould Aunt Mary!&nbsp; D&rsquo;
ye reckon we&rsquo;ll do it, Bill?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dunno.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis ser&rsquo;ous fer
Stavisham.&nbsp; Only eleven on us, there be.&nbsp; Likely March
wunt do &rsquo;t off his own bat&mdash;no, not
&rsquo;arf!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>&lsquo;That there tinker-cove&rsquo;s agoin&rsquo; to
bowl fust.&nbsp; There &rsquo;ee goos!&nbsp; Wot a
&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The rest was drowned in a thunderclap of shouting.&nbsp; There
was a general stampede among the spectators.&nbsp; For the grocer
had driven Daniel&rsquo;s first ball clean into the tent.</p>
<p>It was a bad beginning for Windlecombe, and bad rapidly
changed to worse.&nbsp; Young Daniel bowled steadily and coolly
for the first over, in spite of continuous punishment; but
thereafter he lost first his temper, and then his head.&nbsp; The
smiling grocer played him to all points of the compass; and the
more the grocer smiled, the more wildly erratic Daniel&rsquo;s
bowling grew.&nbsp; As for the Rev. Mr. Weaverly, he could do no
more than send meek, ingenuous balls trundling diffidently up the
pitch; and he was skied with heartrending regularity.&nbsp; The
batsmen kept continually running.&nbsp; The little tent seemed to
belly out on all sides with the cheering, as a sail with
wind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thirty up!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thirty fer nauthin&rsquo;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thirty-one!&nbsp; And another&rsquo;!&nbsp;
Thirty-two!&nbsp; Garn, March!&nbsp; Wot a wazegoose!&nbsp;
Thirty&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Five!&nbsp; &rsquo;Ooray!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The shout went off in my ear like a punt gun.&nbsp; And then
there fell a sudden silence about me, as all strained eyes and
ears out to the field.&nbsp; <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>Some altercation was going on, but
not between members of the opposing sides.&nbsp; &lsquo;Drop ut,
ye ould fule!&rsquo; I heard Tom Clemmer roar; and, peering over
the crowd, I saw Captain Stallwood, ball in hand, walking up to
the pitch.&nbsp; He rolled up his sleeves as he came.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Drop ut, I tell ye!&rsquo; cried Tom once more,
&lsquo;&rsquo;tis crickut we be playin&rsquo;, not maarbles,
man!&nbsp; Gimme that ball, Stall&rsquo;ard, or
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&nbsp; Lorsh! what be come to th&rsquo;
ould&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The rest was a confused wrangle amongst the whole team.&nbsp;
Presently, to our amazement, we saw all drift back to their
posts, and old Stallwood take his place triumphantly at the
bowling-crease.&nbsp; In the dead quiet that followed, I heard
the grocer chuckle richly, as he got ready to smite the Captain
all over the field.</p>
<p>The old man stood stock still on the crease, eyeing the
batsman solemnly, the ball held low down between his knees.&nbsp;
So long he remained in this posture, that at length impatient
exclamations began to break out on all sides.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well! now ye ha&rsquo; got un, Stall&rsquo;ard, let
&rsquo;n goo, mate!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t i&rsquo; church ye be,
Cap&rsquo;n.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis crickut!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bawl up, gaffer!&nbsp; We warnts to get hoame afore
daark!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And from the grocer, leaning with exaggerated weariness on his
bat:</p>
<p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>&lsquo;Doan&rsquo;t ye be i&rsquo; no sorter hurry,
ould bluebottle!&nbsp; But when y&rsquo; are ready, just send us
a postcard, will ye?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Captain&rsquo;s hand went slowly up, the ball held
curiously against his wrist.&nbsp; He launched it with a sudden
sidelong twist.&nbsp; As it rose high into the air, I could see
that it went wide and off, even from my position in the
tent.&nbsp; With a laugh the batsman strode out half a dozen
yards to meet it.&nbsp; A moment later he was gazing back aghast
at his splayed wicket.&nbsp; The Captain&rsquo;s rich husky voice
pealed out above the din:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There be a poun&rsquo; o&rsquo; butter fer
&rsquo;ee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now we were the frantic spectators of a drama that gained
in thrilling interest with every moment.&nbsp; The new batsman
arrived at the wicket, and again old Stallwood sent the ball
sailing down the pitch, wide as ever, but this time to leg.&nbsp;
I watched it more carefully now.&nbsp; Though it made a high
curve, it rose not a hair&rsquo;s-breadth after touching ground,
but shot straight in.&nbsp; Again we saw the glint of a falling
bail behind the wicket.&nbsp; The Captain thrust both bare arms
deep in his trousers-flap, and silently grinned.&nbsp; The third
man did little better.&nbsp; He succeeded in blocking a couple of
the balls; but the next, more crooked than any, sent him
dumbfounded back to the tent.</p>
<p>There was no more ribaldry about me now.&nbsp; <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>The fourth
batsman sallied out amidst a rustle of whispered apprehension and
hard-drawn breaths, and returned almost immediately to the same
tense atmosphere.&nbsp; Outside on the benches, the old men were
rocking on their seats with delight, like trees in a wind.&nbsp;
Bleak, the cobbler, was careering up and down, beside himself
with joy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fower in a hover!&rsquo; he shouted.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
reckons I knaws summat about leather, but I ne&rsquo;er seed it
do the like o&rsquo; that!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
bawlin&rsquo;, I tell ye: &rsquo;tis magic!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now young Daniel Dray was bowling again, and bowling with
renewed courage and skill.&nbsp; All his old command of length
and break had returned to him.&nbsp; By the end of his over,
another wicket had fallen, and the score had risen no higher than
forty-three.&nbsp; The Captain took the ball once more, this time
without any opposition.&nbsp; At once the fearsome whispering in
the tent grew still.&nbsp; Almost we forgot to breathe, as the
great dark hairy fist came slowly up into the sunlight.</p>
<p>But the Captain had changed his tactics.&nbsp; Instead of the
leisurely, high-curving delivery with which he had done such
execution hitherto, the ball left his hand straight and low and
as quick as light.&nbsp; It pitched no more than an inch or two
in front of the waiting bat, then struck <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>vertically
upward.&nbsp; A crack resounded through the field.&nbsp; The
batsman staggered&mdash;clapped a hand to his head.&nbsp; A
moment more and he was picking an uneven course towards the tent,
thoroughly satiated with the Captain&rsquo;s magic.</p>
<p>Very slowly the next man set out for the pitch.&nbsp; He
stopped on the way to tighten a strap of his leg-guard, and again
unconscionably long to adjust his batting-glove.&nbsp; Once he
turned back a tallowy face, and seemed to be in two minds about
something.&nbsp; But at length he got to the wicket and grounded
his bat.&nbsp; The long arm uprose again, and the ball
sped.&nbsp; It proved to be the last bowled that day.&nbsp; For
once more that terrible upward break ended with a thud and a
yell, echoed from nine panic-stricken men about me.&nbsp; The
luckless batsman fled with as gory a visage as his companion had
done, and none would take his place, though the grocer charmed
and stormed never so wisely.&nbsp; Windlecombe had won by
six.</p>
<p>Later by an hour the victorious eleven gathered in the parlour
of the Three Thatchers Inn, old Stallwood grimly smiling in their
midst.&nbsp; Tom Clemmer shook his fist at him, delight in his
eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But &rsquo;twarn&rsquo;t crickut,
Stall&rsquo;ard!&rsquo; he said reproachfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Noa,&rsquo; returned the old man, &lsquo;not crickut,
<a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>leastways not all on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; That there
sing-chin-summat or other&mdash;Red Hot Ball, I calls
un&mdash;that wur a trick as I larned in Chaney.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>How fast time flies you can never truly estimate until you go
step and step with it through the summer woods and fields.&nbsp;
In a sense, town-life&mdash;where there is so much of permanence
in environment&mdash;puts a drag on time, and not seldom pulls it
up altogether.&nbsp; Moreover, in towns time is estimated by
events, by experiences.&nbsp; You hear a great musician, see a
great play, look on at some magnificent pageant, or are shocked
by some catastrophe; and straightway there is half a lifetime of
emotion thrust between two strokes of the clock.&nbsp; By so much
in very truth your life has been lengthened; for it is the
intensity of living that counts in the civic tale of years.&nbsp;
If you find an old man not only declaring that he has lived long,
but believing it, it is a great chance but he tells you so in the
close-clipped cockney tongue of the town.</p>
<p>And yet it is better to live in some far-away country nook
like Windlecombe, and be reminded with every gliding summer hour
that time flies and life is short, if only because of the
undoubted fact that such a frame of mind carries a belief <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>in eternal
youth as a necessary implication.&nbsp; Between life&rsquo;s dawn
and the dusk of its western sky, there is literally no time to
grow old in a natural, aboriginal environment.&nbsp; So
inextricably interwoven are the threads of human existence and
that of the green world round about, that the annual rejuvenation
of the one infallibly communicates itself to the other.&nbsp;
With every spring we start life afresh.&nbsp; Though we may live
to threescore years and ten, we are children still; and come upon
death at last like an unexpected gust at a corner, old age
unrealised to the very end.</p>
<p>In the weeks that are closing now, I have heard and seen more
of the galloping hoofs of this swift, high-stepping jade, summer,
than is good for entire peace of mind.&nbsp; Years ago I made a
vow that I would never again eke out the fleeting golden days,
like a miser to whom spending is not pleasure but only
pain.&nbsp; I vowed that I would always squander time at this
season; let it drift by unthinkingly; get my fill of sunshine,
and fill and fill again to my heart&rsquo;s content; yet do it as
a strayed heifer in the corn, wantoning over an acre to each
mouthful.&nbsp; But this time, as ever, the good resolution has
been forgotten.&nbsp; The old parsimony has dogged the way at
every step.&nbsp; I must be up with the sun in the small hours of
each morning, fearful of losing a single <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>beam from
the millions.&nbsp; To waste in sleep the blue, spangled summer
nights, when all the country-side is resonant of life and
fragrant with the scent that comes only with the darkness, has
seemed like sacrilege.&nbsp; Yet, for all my industry, July is
nearing its end, and I know that I have drunk but a drop or two
out of its vast ocean.&nbsp; And already I have renewed the old
vow, to be disregarded as ever, doubtless, when July again comes
round.</p>
<p>On all the high-lying corn lands now, harvest has begun; and
the fields in the valley are fast taking on that deep tinge of
gipsy-gold which is the sign of full maturity.&nbsp; Scarce had
the shrill note of the mowing-machine stilled in the meadows,
when the deeper voice of the reaper-and-binder began on the
hill.&nbsp; All day long I sat in this cool quiet nook of a
study, and the steady jarring sound came over to me from the
hillside, filling the little room.&nbsp; I saw the machine with
its pair of grey horses, waiting at the field-gate, while the
scythe-men cut a way for it into the amber wall of the
grain.&nbsp; Steadily hour after hour it worked round the field,
until at last, looking forth towards noon, I saw that only a
small triangular piece remained uncut in the middle of the
field.</p>
<p>Now there were a score or so of the farm folk waiting hard by,
each armed with a cudgel; <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>and with them seemingly every dog in
the village.&nbsp; As the machine went round, every time making
the patch of standing corn smaller, I could see rabbits bolting
in all directions from the diminishing cover; and there uprose
continually a hubbub of voices from dogs and men.&nbsp; Towards
the end, the stubble became alive with the little dark scurrying
forms, fleeing to the surrounding fields, the most of them
escaping harmlessly for want of pursuers.&nbsp; But even then, as
I afterwards learned, some eight or nine dozen were killed.</p>
<p>I have always kept away from these harvest battues, as indeed
from all scenes of sport and congregations of sportsmen.&nbsp; I
am willing enough to profit by these activities, and receive and
enjoy my full share of the furred and feathered spoil admittedly
without one humanitarian qualm.&nbsp; But this much confessed, I
would gladly welcome the day when everywhere, save in the rabbit
warrens, the sound of the sporting gun should cease throughout
this southern land.&nbsp; Rabbits must be kept down to the end of
time; but, for the creatures that require preservation, too great
a price is paid, and paid by the wrong class.&nbsp; It is not the
owner of game-preserves who bears the main cost of his thunderous
pleasuring.&nbsp; It is the lover of wild life, who sees the
hawks and owls and small deer of the woodlands growing scarcer
with every year; and the children who, <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>in the
springtime, are cheated out of their right to wander through the
primrose glades.</p>
<p>To many this may seem a wearisomely trite point of view,
affecting a grievance as old as the hills, and even less likely
of obliteration.&nbsp; But though the point of view is ancient
enough, the grievance is no longer so.&nbsp; Of late years the
ranks of village dwellers have been very largely reinforced from
the classes who care little for sport and a great deal for all
other allurements of the country-side.&nbsp; Rural England is no
longer peopled by sportsmen and the dependents of sportsmen; but,
slowly and surely, a majority is creeping up in the villages,
composed of men and women both knowing and loving Nature, and to
whom the old-time local policy of endurance under deprivation of
rights for expediency&rsquo;s sake, is an incomprehensible, as
well as an intolerable thing.&nbsp; All the vast-winged,
beautiful marauders of the air that I love to watch, are
ruthlessly shot down by the gamekeepers on a suspicion
presumptive and unproved; but the fox that, in a single night,
massacres every bird in the villager&rsquo;s hen-roost, must go
scatheless because poor profit may not be set before rich
pastime.</p>
<p>One day, almost the hottest so far, I was out in the meadows,
and came upon a curious thing.&nbsp; The path, or rather green
lane, ran between high <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>hedges.&nbsp; On either hand there
was a great field of flowering crops, the one red clover, the
other sainfoin.&nbsp; There must have been twenty or thirty acres
of each stretching away under the tense still air and light, much
of a colour, but the sainfoin of a softer, purer pink.&nbsp; Both
fields seemed alike attractive to the bees; but while, to the
right, the sainfoin gave out a mighty note of organ music, the
red clover on my left was utterly silent.&nbsp; Looking through a
gap in the foliage, I could not see there a single butterfly or
bee.&nbsp; The truth, of course, was that the nectar in the
trumpet-petals of the clover was too far down for the honey-bee
to reach; nor would even the bumble-bees trouble about it, with a
whole province of sainfoin hard by, over-brimming with choicer,
more attainable sweets.</p>
<p>As I wandered along, between these great zones of sound and
silence, the air seemed to grow hotter and more oppressive with
every moment.&nbsp; There was something uncanny in the stillness
of all around me.&nbsp; The green sprays in the tops of the
highest elms lay against the blue sky sharp and clear, as though
enamelled upon it.&nbsp; Not a bird sang in the woodland.&nbsp;
Save for the deep throbbing melody from the sainfoin, all the
world lay dumb and stupefied under the noontide glare.&nbsp; And
then, chancing to turn and look southward, I saw the cause of
it.&nbsp; A storm was coming up.&nbsp; <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>Close down
on the horizon lay a bank of cloud like a solid billow of
ink.&nbsp; It was driving up at incredible speed.&nbsp; Though
not a leaf or grass blade stirred around me, the cloud seemed
tossed and torn in a whirlwind&rsquo;s grip.&nbsp; Every moment
it lifted higher towards the sun, changing its shape incessantly,
black fold upon fold rolling together, colliding, giving place to
others blacker still.&nbsp; And flying in advance of all this,
borne by a still swifter air-current, were long sombre streamers
of cloud rent into every conceivable shape of torn and tattered
rags.</p>
<p>And now, as the dense cloud-pack got up, the brilliant light
was blotted out at a stroke, and this startling thing
happened.&nbsp; Every bee, apparently, at work in the vast field
of sainfoin, spread her wings at the ominous signal, and raced
for home.&nbsp; They swept over my head in numbers that literally
darkened the sky.&nbsp; Again, literally, the sound of their
going was like a continuous deep syren-note, striking point-blank
in the ear.&nbsp; For a minute at most it endured, and then died
away almost as suddenly as it came.&nbsp; A bleak ghostly light
paled on everything around me.&nbsp; Little cat&rsquo;s paws of
wind flung through the torpid air.&nbsp; Afar the harsh voice of
the oncoming tempest sounded.&nbsp; Slow hot gouts of water began
to fall, and every moment the inky pall of cloud lit up with an
internal fire.</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>At
first, as I made off homeward in the track of the vanished
bee-army, I tried to emulate their speed.&nbsp; But the torrent
came surging and crying up in my rear, and in a dozen yards I was
waterlogged.&nbsp; Thereafter, going leisurely, I came at last
into the village, and so to the house.&nbsp; And here, in spite
of the deluge, I must stop and look on at more wonders.&nbsp; It
seemed almost impossible for any bird to sustain itself on wings
under such a cataract.&nbsp; But there above me the martins were
at their old incessant gambols, circling and darting about,
hither and thither, high and low, in a whirling madcap crew; and
higher still, right in the throat of the tempest, I could make
out the swifts, hundreds strong, weaving their old mazy pattern
on the sky, as though in the pearl and opal dusk of a
summer&rsquo;s evening.</p>
<h2><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>THE
TEA-GARDEN<br />
AUGUST</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Runridge&rsquo;s misadventure
in wedlock has proved a trouble to more people than one in
Windlecombe.&nbsp; In former years, though boating parties from
the town were continually to be seen on the river, when the
August holiday season began, they seldom pulled up at our ferry
stairs.&nbsp; From the waterside the village had a somewhat
inhospitable look, while a mile farther on there were the North
Woods, Stavisham&rsquo;s traditional picnicking ground, where, at
the gamekeeper&rsquo;s cottage, all were sure of a welcome.&nbsp;
Such wandering holiday-makers as found their way into Windlecombe
came usually by road, and were of the tranquil, undemonstrative
breed, like pedestrians all the world over.&nbsp; There would
seem to be something about sitting long hours in a rowing-boat
which is detrimental, even debasing, to a certain common variety
of human nature.&nbsp; The tendency to run and shout and skylark
on reaching dry ground again appears to be irresistible to this
numerous class.&nbsp; And it is at <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>Mrs. Runridge&rsquo;s door that we
must lay the blame of submitting Windlecombe to a pestilent
innovation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look ye!&rsquo; said the old ferryman from his seat in
the boat, waving a scornful hand towards his garden, as I chanced
along the river bank one fine Saturday afternoon.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Twur me as painted un, an&rsquo; me as putt un up,
jest fer peace&rsquo;s sake; but I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; taken
an&rsquo; chucked un in th&rsquo; river if I&rsquo;d only
ha&rsquo; knowed what sort o&rsquo; peace &rsquo;ud come on
&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A great white board reared itself on ungainly legs above the
elder-hedge of the garden, and on it, in huge irregular
characters, appeared the single word, &lsquo;TEAS.&rsquo;&nbsp;
By the side of the ferry-punt half a dozen town rowing-boats lay
moored.&nbsp; And from the green depths of the garden there arose
a confusion of voices, shrill laughter, and an incessant clatter
of crockery.&nbsp; I had hardly realised what it all meant, when
Mrs. Runridge showed a vast white apron and a hot perspiring face
in the gateway.&nbsp; She bore down upon us with upraised hand,
as though she intended bodily harm to one or both.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, Joe!&rsquo; cried she, giving the old ferryman a
coin.&nbsp; &lsquo;Change fer half a suvverrin, an&rsquo; shaarp
&rsquo;s th&rsquo; wured!&nbsp; Try th&rsquo; Thatchers, or Mist.
Weaverly, or belike&mdash;&nbsp; Doan&rsquo;t sit starin&rsquo;
there, looney!&nbsp; Dear, oh Lor! was there ever sech a <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>man!&nbsp;
An&rsquo; us all run purty nigh off our legses, we be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Th&rsquo; seventh time,&rsquo; gasped Runridge, as we
hurried together up the steep street, &lsquo;or like as not
th&rsquo; eighth&mdash;I dunno!&nbsp; An&rsquo; ut bean&rsquo;t
as though &rsquo;a warnted money.&nbsp; Money?&mdash;th&rsquo;
bed bean&rsquo;t fit fer Christian folk to sleep on, wi&rsquo;
th&rsquo; lumps in &rsquo;t!&nbsp; An&rsquo; to-morrer ull be
wuss, if &rsquo;tis fine.&nbsp; Lor&rsquo; send a hearthquake, or
Noah&rsquo;s flood, or summat!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When a naturally silent man attempts self-commiseration in
words, his case is sure to be a desperate one.&nbsp; But we are
all fated to share in his trouble now.&nbsp; On any fine Saturday
or Sunday in the month, Runridge will be a familiar figure,
hunting down from door to door the change that, in villages, is
so scanty and so hard to discover.&nbsp; On Mondays we shall all
suffer from our foolish kindness in allowing this reckless
exportation of bullion.&nbsp; Only Susan Angel at the sweetstuff
shop, and her small customers, will be unincommoded; for the
handful of battered farthings that has served them as currency
during whole decades past will be necessarily saved by its
insignificance, and will remain, no doubt, in the village for
service amidst generations yet unborn.</p>
<p>But disturbing visitors to Windlecombe do not all come by the
river.&nbsp; There is an iniquitous <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>job-master in Stavisham who has long
had the village in his evil eye; and at intervals, fortunately
rare, he descends upon us with charabancs drawn by three horses,
and filled with heterogeneous human gleanings&mdash;the flotsam
and jetsam of holiday-land strayed for the day into Stavisham
from contiguous seaside towns.</p>
<p>They come in families, in amorous couples, in collective
friendships of each sex and every number and age.&nbsp; They
bring baskets of provisions, cameras, balls wherewith to play
rounders on the green; and of musical instruments many weird
kinds&mdash;concertinas, mouth-organs, babies, and often yapping
terriers that set all our own dogs frantic on their chains.&nbsp;
An altruist, whose convictions have grown up amidst the quiet
slow neighbourliness of the country, never finds his principles
less easy of application than when he must atune himself to the
holiday moods of people escaped from the town.&nbsp; There is no
harm in all the shouting and laughter and fatuous
horseplay.&nbsp; Inebriety is practically extinct among those who
make summer the season, and the country the scene, of their
year&rsquo;s brief merry-making.&nbsp; And yet it all seems
mistaken, reprehensible, on the same principle that a blunder is
worse than a crime.&nbsp; It is futile to tell him so, unless he
already knows it, and then <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>it is equally unnecessary; but when
the day-tripper learns to enjoy himself on the green country-side
in the true spirit for which the sun was made to shine and the
flowers to grow, he will have found the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone
that is to change, not mere lead and iron, but Time and Life
themselves into gold.</p>
<p>On most mornings in August the more careful of us will go
about thrusting greasy paper-scraps out of sight under bushes,
flicking the incongruous yellow of banana-peel into obscure
corners, lamenting stripped boughs, and marvelling at nosegays
thrown heedlessly away, as if the joy of them had lain in the
mere plucking.&nbsp; But all the strange folk that use the
village for their pleasuring at this time, do not leave these
unlovely tokens behind them.&nbsp; Only yesterday, as I sat on
the edge of the old worked-out, riverside chalk-pit
here&mdash;whence you have a view north and south of the
glittering water for miles&mdash;there came a new sound in the
air, and I must throw aside my sheaf of galley-proofs to
listen.&nbsp; The sound came from the river, and was still afar
off.&nbsp; Many voices were joined in singing one of the old
catch-songs, which go round a circle of three or four phrases,
and to which there is never an end until you make an end of its
beginning in slow time.</p>
<p>The sweet medley grew louder and clearer, and <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>presently
there was united to it the rhythmic plash of oars.&nbsp; A great
tarry old sea-boat came round the water&rsquo;s bend, holding a
party of a dozen or so.&nbsp; At last the labouring craft and the
music came to a halt together, and the singers clambered
ashore.&nbsp; I should have forgotten all about them now, for
they soon passed out of sight amid the waterside foliage.&nbsp;
But as I was coming homeward up the village street, I heard the
voices again; and there, under the Seven Sisters on the green,
the little company were standing together, singing apparently for
their own solace and delight.&nbsp; It was a strange thing, here
in unemotional England, and many of the village folk had been
drawn wonderingly to their doors.&nbsp; Yet the singers did not
seem to remark this, nor to regard their action as anything out
of the common.&nbsp; For, the song finished, they broke into
several parties and sauntered on, talking quietly amongst
themselves as if to make music were part of the daily
conversation of their lives.</p>
<p>All that afternoon, from the quiet of my garden, I heard the
voices at intervals, and from different points about the village,
near and far.&nbsp; Once I saw the party right on the top of
Windle Hill, strolling about in twos and threes, looking like
foraging crows on the heights.&nbsp; After a while I saw them get
together in a little circle; and then, <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>right at
the ear&rsquo;s-tip, I could just catch the higher notes of their
singing&mdash;a strange wild song, much like the song of the
larks that must be contending with them up there against the blue
sky.</p>
<p>The last I saw of this mysterious company was at sunset, from
my perch over the chalk-pit again.&nbsp; They had already
embarked when I arrived, and had got their little ship well under
way.&nbsp; The oars were dipping steadily to the same old
catch-song that had brought them hither: there was still a faint
throbbing echo of &lsquo;White Sand and Grey Sand&rsquo; upon the
air long after the sun had plunged, and the pale half-moon was
beginning to enter a timid silver protest against the lingering
crimson in the sky.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Near upon half a century I have lived in the world, and cannot
yet say of the wind whether I hate it or love it most.</p>
<p>It is a dilemma that comes only to the dweller in the country,
for in a town no sane man can be in two minds on the
matter.&nbsp; With a careering, mephitic dust choking up all
organs of perception, and the risk of being cloven to the chine
by a roof slate or lassoed by a loose electric wire, no one can
think of wind, hot or cold, <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>without heartily wishing it
gone.&nbsp; But in the country, though for my old enemy, the
northeast wind, I have nothing but fear and detestation at all
seasons, warm gales, whether in winter or summer, come as often
in friendly as in inimical guise.&nbsp; Like certain of the Hindu
gods, the wind must be content to be treated according to the
outcome of its activities, and receive laudation or revilement as
this prove fair or foul.</p>
<p>All through to-day the south-west wind has been volleying up
the combe, and everywhere in the village there has been a hubbub
of slamming doors and rattling casements, and the flack and
clutter of linen drying on the garden lines.&nbsp; People fought
their way step by step down the hill against the wind, and
tripped lightly up it, the oldest and feeblest forced into a
smart jog-trot.&nbsp; Aprons were blown over faces, and hats
snatched off at corners.&nbsp; The trees overshadowing the
village have been lashing together, and roaring out a deep
continuous song.&nbsp; The three thatchers on the inn sign, each
with a gilded hod of straw, have been flashing signals up to my
window every time the sun broke through the flying storm-wrack;
and a hundred times in the long day some riding witch of a
rain-cloud has tried to drench us, but each time the south-west
gale has seized it by the tattered skirts <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>and chevied
it away over the hills before it could shed a dozen drops.</p>
<p>But it has been a good wind all through, and fine heartening
weather; and I have been glad to be abroad in it whenever I could
spare or steal an hour.&nbsp; Said the old vicar, as we climbed
up Windle Hill together this morning, his long white beard
flowing out before him as he lay back on the blast:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what you would have done, if I had let you
choose the way.&nbsp; You would have struck deep into the woods,
like the butterflies, and missed all the healthy buffeting of
it.&nbsp; But there is only one place for a man to-day, and that
is on the open Down.&nbsp; It never pays in the long-run in life
to study how to keep out of the way of hard knocks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sunshine raced ahead of us, vaulted the hilltop, and was
gone.&nbsp; A scatter of warm rain drove out of the grey
heaven.&nbsp; I turned up my coat-collar just in time to
intercept the returning sun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;True,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but the good of hard knocks
depends not on their frequency, but on the profit you extract
from them.&nbsp; I get and keep designedly as much of this as I
can, so a little goes a long way with me.&nbsp; And I love the
quiet and stillness of the deep wood, when the wind is roaring
out in the open.&nbsp; If we had gone there to-day, we should
have found the rosebay <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>willowherbs in full bloom, and more
butterflies upon them than you could find in a week
elsewhere.&nbsp; Besides, the ups in life are just as good for
one as the downs.&nbsp; I can admire the old Scotch pine that
clings to the bare hill-top through a century of winter storms,
but I must not be inconsiderate of the lilies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old Windlecombe vicar has a way of dealing with notions of
this kind which is good for his hearer, whether he allow himself
convinced, or consider his dignity affronted.&nbsp; He ventilates
such ideas as he would let light into a room, by dashing a rough
hand through the dust-grimed window.&nbsp; It is a method
unpicturesque and often brutal, but effective and salutary in the
main.&nbsp; I owe him gratefully many a pretty rainbow bubble of
conceit exploded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pluck your head out of the sand,&rsquo; quoth he,
&lsquo;for your ragged hinder-parts are visible to all the world
of honest eyes.&nbsp; The pine and the lily are not choosing
creatures.&nbsp; To them is their environment allotted, but to
you is given the wilful fashioning of it.&nbsp; A man may be
either gold or iron&mdash;made either for beauty or for
use.&nbsp; But the one will not decorate, nor the other uphold
the world, if he shirk the fires that must first refine or temper
him.&nbsp; So away with your foolish Sahara tricks, and get on
with the work the moment brings you.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>By
this he meant I was to look about me, and tell him what I saw as
we went along, a duty in which I was too often an unintentional
malingerer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yesterday a Londoner was in the village,&rsquo; I told
him, for a start, &lsquo;and he was scoffing at our Downs.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are the green highlands of
Sussex I have read so much about?&nbsp; Why, the hills are not
green, but brown!&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was quite true at this
season, and from his standpoint down in the valley.&nbsp; Up here
we can see what gives the Downs their rich bronze colour in
summer-time.&nbsp; From below they looked parched and sunburnt,
as though nothing could grow for the heat and drought.&nbsp; But
now I can see that the general brown tone is really a mingling of
a thousand living hues.&nbsp; Looking straight down as you walk,
the turf is as green as ever it was; but a dozen paces onward all
this fresh verdure is lost under the greys and drabs of the
seeding grass-heads.&nbsp; Then again, the brown colour is due
just as much to the blending of all other colours that the eye
separates at a close view, but confuses from afar.&nbsp; We are
walking on a carpet of flowers; we cannot avoid trampling them,
if we are to set foot to the ground at all.&nbsp; Yellow
goatsbeard and vetchling, and the little trefoil with the
blood-red tips to its petals, and golden hawkweed everywhere; for
blues, there <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>are millions of plantains, and sheepsbit, and
harebells; and the wild thyme purples half the hillside, making
the bright carmine of the orchids brighter still wherever it
blows.&nbsp; But I have not reckoned in half the flowers
that&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold, enough!&nbsp; I am sick of your Londoner, and of
every human being for the moment.&nbsp; Listen to the free,
glorious wind!&nbsp; Down in the valley there we always think of
the wind as a creature with a voice&mdash;something striding
through the sky and calling as it goes.&nbsp; But up here we know
that it is the earth that calls.&nbsp; Hark to it swishing, and
surging, and sighing for miles round!&nbsp; The sound is never
overhead on these treeless wastes, but always underfoot.&nbsp;
You keep head and shoulders up in the soundless sunshine, and
walk in a maelstrom.&nbsp; Did you ever think that the larks
always sing in the midst of silence, no matter how hard the wind
blows?&nbsp; Those are George Artlett&rsquo;s sheep we are coming
to, are they not?&nbsp; I ought to know the old dog&rsquo;s
talk!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I scanned the hills about me, but could see no sign of sheep,
shepherd, or dog.&nbsp; But as we drew to the edge of the wide
plateau we were traversing, and got a view down into the steep
combe beyond, there sure enough were all three.&nbsp; The sheep,
just growing artistically presentable after their June shearing,
were scattered over the deep <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>bottom, quietly nibbling at the
turf.&nbsp; Far below, in the shadow of a single stunted
hawthorn, sat young George Artlett scribbling on his knee.&nbsp;
No doubt Rowster had been lying by his master&rsquo;s side, until
our shadows struck sheer down upon him from the brink of the
hill.&nbsp; But now he was up and pricking his ears sharply in
our direction, growling menaces and wagging a welcome at one and
the same time.&nbsp; I gave the Reverend what I saw in few
words.&nbsp; To my surprise he began to descend the steep
hill-side.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

 src="images/n6.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;After all,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;George Artlett and I
never really fell out.&nbsp; But we agreed to differ, and that is
the most fatal, most lasting disagreement of all.&nbsp; I should
have known better.&nbsp; I think I will risk a hand to him
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As we clambered down the precipitous slope, into the shelter
of the combe, the wind suddenly stopped its music in our
ears.&nbsp; There fell a dead calm about us.&nbsp; At the bottom,
we seemed to be walking between two widely separated, yet almost
perpendicular cliffs of green, with a great span of blue sky far
above, across which the heavy cumuli raged unceasingly.&nbsp;
George Artlett got to his feet at our approach, thrust his paper
into his pocket, and gravely clawed off his old tarpaulin
hat.&nbsp; He took the hand held out to him with wonder, and a
little hesitation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how fares the good work, George?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>Artlett was silent a moment.&nbsp; He tried to read the
sightless eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shepherdin&rsquo;, sir?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis allers slow
goin&rsquo;, but goin&rsquo; all th&rsquo; time.&nbsp; We did
famous with th&rsquo; wool, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;George, leave the wool alone.&nbsp; You know what I
mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>George Artlett swung round on his heel, and swung back
again.&nbsp; He counted the fingers on his gnarled hand slowly
one by one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be ut priest to lost runagate, or be ut man to
man?&rsquo; he asked, looking up suddenly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is just one child in the dark way putting forth hand
to another.&nbsp; For, to the best of us, George, comradeship can
be no more than a heartening touch and sound of a footstep going
a common road, and the voice of a friend.&nbsp; Do you see a
light at the end of your path?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay!&nbsp; I do that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look closer.&nbsp; Is not the light just the shine of a
Beautiful Face, very grave and sorrowful, but with a great joy
beginning to spread over it, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though the deep voice stemmed on in the sunny quiet of the
combe, I could distinguish the words no longer; for something,
that was by no means part of me but of a more delicate nurture,
had set my feet going against my will.&nbsp; I was halfway down
the long alley of the combe before I <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>stopped to wait for the old
vicar.&nbsp; And then, looking backward, I fell to staring with
all my eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Reverend,&rsquo; said I, after he had rejoined me, and
we had walked on together in silence for a minute or two,
&lsquo;I wish you could see what is before me now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had brought him out of his reverie with a jerk.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well: on with it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see a green sunlit space, with the shadow of an old
hawthorn upon it.&nbsp; And in the shadow I see two men kneeling,
bareheaded, their faces turned up to the sky.&nbsp; And with all
my heart I wish there were a third with them; but there is not
another fit for such company, to my certain knowledge, within ten
thousand miles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to weigh his reply before he uttered it.&nbsp;
But:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a good fool,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and I
love you.&nbsp; And there were three there, nay! a
Fourth,&mdash;all the time.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>In winter-time, &lsquo;when nights are dark and ways be
foul,&rsquo; I can conceive of no pleasanter aspect of village
life at any season than the indoor, fireside one; but when the
long radiant August evenings are here, there is equally no other
time for me.&nbsp; More and more, with every <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>year that
glides by, life in Windlecombe at this season seems to focus
itself round the Seven Sisters&rsquo; trees upon the green.&nbsp;
All the summer day through, the old folk gather there; and always
a low murmur of voices comes drifting up to my window from their
garrulous company.&nbsp; But it is after the day&rsquo;s work is
done, and all, able or disable, are free for recreation, that the
true life of the place begins.</p>
<p>There is something about the ease-taking of men physically
tired after a long day&rsquo;s work in fresh air and sunshine,
that fascinates one who is only mind-weary, and that alone from
much chaffering with pen and ink.&nbsp; Though you have but
cramped limbs to stretch out over the green sward, and, by
comparison, but a torpid, attenuated flow in your veins, somewhat
of your neighbour&rsquo;s healthful, dog-tired humour over-brims
upon you; and after a pipe or two, and an hour&rsquo;s slow
desultory chat, you can almost forget the tang of the study, the
reek of old leather burdening imprisoned air, and congratulate
yourself on a man&rsquo;s work manfully done, albeit
vicariously&mdash;the day-long tussle with the good earth,
mammoth &lsquo;nunches&rsquo; and &lsquo;eleveners&rsquo;
devoured under hedgerows, a shirt a score of times soused with
honest sweat, and as many dried by the thirsty harvest sun.</p>
<p>All the old Windlecombe faces were there <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>to-night
under the drooping pine boughs, and most of the middle-aged
ones.&nbsp; The younger men and boys were down on the Mead at
cricket practice, and there they would stay as long as a glimmer
of daylight remained in the sky.&nbsp; But the sun had still a
fathom to go before it would lie, red and lusty, caught in the
toils of the far-off Stavisham hills.&nbsp; I evaded with what
grace I could the cake of ship&rsquo;s tobacco held out to me by
Captain Stallwood, accepting as fair compromise a charge from the
tin box of old Tom Clemmer, his dearest friend.&nbsp; Gradually
the talk got back to the point where my coming had intersected
it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis trew,&rsquo; said the Captain now,
&lsquo;trew as I sets here on a plank o&rsquo; th&rsquo; ould
<i>King</i>, as ye cut an&rsquo; shaped yersel&rsquo;,
Dan&rsquo;l.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I followed his glance round the circle of benches.&nbsp; There
was not a head among the company but was wagging dubiously.&nbsp;
Old Daniel Dray&rsquo;s face was an incredulous, a horrified
blank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;a human critter swaller
seventeen live&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I seed it,&rsquo; interrupted the Captain, pointing his
pipe-stem solemnly at us for emphasis, &lsquo;I seed it wi&rsquo;
my own pair o&rsquo; eyes.&nbsp; Little lirrupy green chaps, they
was, all hoppin&rsquo; an&rsquo; somersettin&rsquo; i&rsquo;
th&rsquo; baasket.&nbsp; An&rsquo; th&rsquo; blackamoor, &rsquo;a
putts &rsquo;a&rsquo;s mouth to th&rsquo; lip o&rsquo; it,
an&rsquo; &ldquo;hap! hap!&rdquo; sez he, an&rsquo; every time
&rsquo;a sez it, wan o&rsquo; &rsquo;em jumps <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>in.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; when they was all down, &rsquo;a gies a sort o&rsquo;
gruggle, an&rsquo; skews &rsquo;a&rsquo;s head ower th&rsquo;
baasket, an&rsquo; &ldquo;hap! hap!&rdquo; sez he agen, an&rsquo;
every time &rsquo;a sez it, out pops&mdash;&nbsp; But there!
&rsquo;tis no sense tellin&rsquo; ye!&nbsp; Folks sees naun
o&rsquo; th&rsquo; wureld i&rsquo; little small village places,
an&rsquo; an&rsquo;t got no believes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was silent a while, then brought out a tobacco-box like a
brass halfpenny bun, and held it up to the common view.&nbsp; It
was old and battered, and had certain initials scratched on the
lid.&nbsp; The Captain fingered it in mournful reminiscence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lookee now,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I doan&rsquo;t
rightly know as I ever telled ye.&nbsp; &ldquo;G.B.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That bean&rsquo;t Tom Stall&rsquo;ard, be ut?&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; No,
sez all on ye, ready enow.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twur George&rsquo;s, ould
George Budgen as&mdash;&nbsp; Dan&rsquo;l, what year war&rsquo;t
as I went aff to sea?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Daniel Dray&rsquo;s lips moved in silent calculation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seventy-three belike, or maybe seventy-four,
&rsquo;cause ye&rsquo;d been gone, Joe, a year afore
Harker&rsquo;s coo slipped the five-legged heifer, an&rsquo; that
wur&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay! trew, Dan&rsquo;l.&nbsp; An&rsquo; George Budgen,
&rsquo;a wur shipmate along o&rsquo; me purty soon arter I gooed
away.&nbsp; Well: an&rsquo; this here baccy-box&mdash;th&rsquo;
least time as I seed ut i&rsquo; George&rsquo;s haand, &rsquo;a

An&rsquo; ut come on to blaw that night&mdash;Gorm! <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>how
&rsquo;t did blaw!&nbsp; An&rsquo; <i>rain</i>, not aarf!&nbsp;
An&rsquo; i&rsquo; th&rsquo; marnin&rsquo; never a sign o&rsquo;
pore George Budgen to be seen!&nbsp; Well now, full a fortnit
arter that, what &rsquo;ud we do but ketch a gurt thresher on a
trail-line, an&rsquo; inside o&rsquo; th&rsquo; crittur what
&rsquo;ud we find but a halibut, big as a tay-tray, all alive
an&rsquo; lippin&rsquo;, &rsquo;a wur.&nbsp; Sez th&rsquo;
cappen&mdash;I wur ship&rsquo;s-boy then&mdash;&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo;
sez he, &ldquo;git an&rsquo; clane un, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
ha&rsquo; un fer me supper,&rdquo; &rsquo;a sez.&nbsp; Now then,
Dan&rsquo;l, ye&rsquo;ll never believe ut, but trew as ye sets
there, clink goes my knife agen summut inside o&rsquo; th&rsquo;
halibut, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Goo on, Stallard!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He, he!&nbsp; We all knaws what be acomin&rsquo;,

<p>&lsquo;An&rsquo; there wur&mdash;ah! but ye&rsquo;ll
ne&rsquo;er believe ut, not if ye was Jonah hisself&mdash;there,
inside o&rsquo; th&rsquo; halibut wur a gurt rusty hook
as&mdash;&nbsp; What-say, Dan&rsquo;l?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doan&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee say ut agen, Dan&rsquo;l!&nbsp;
You a reg&rsquo;lar prayers-gooer, too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Captain filled his pipe from the box, tragically
ruminating in the silence that followed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! pore George Budgen!&nbsp; &rsquo;A little knowed as
&rsquo;twould be th&rsquo; laast time as &rsquo;a &rsquo;d pass
his tobaccer-box to a friend!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sun had long set, and the dusk was creeping up
apace.&nbsp; Here and there in the shadowy length of the street,
lights were beginning to break out.</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>Where
we sat under the dense canopy of pine-boughs, night had already
asserted itself, and to one another we were little more than an
arc of glowing pipe-bowls.&nbsp; Old Stallwood chuckled richly
from his corner.&nbsp; A sort of inspiration of mendacity seemed
to have come over him to-night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Lor&rsquo; bless ye!&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;that
bean&rsquo;t nauthin&rsquo;!&mdash;not when ye&rsquo;ve been
five-an&rsquo;-thirty year at sea.&nbsp; I knowed a man wanst as
worked in a steam sawmill way over in Amurricky somewheres;
an&rsquo; what did &rsquo;a do wan fine marnin&rsquo; but get
hisself sawed i&rsquo; two pieces; an&rsquo; wan piece
died&mdash;th&rsquo; doctor cud do nought to save ut.&nbsp; But
t&rsquo;other piece kep&rsquo; alive for ten year
arterwards&mdash;ah! an&rsquo; did a man&rsquo;s work every
day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Old Daniel bounced to his feet.&nbsp; He breathed hard for a
full half-minute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Joe Stall&rsquo;ard!&rsquo; he said at last, severely,
&lsquo;shame on ye fer a reg&rsquo;lar, hout-an&rsquo;-hout, ould
leear!&nbsp; A man cut in two?&nbsp; An&rsquo; lived ten year
arter&mdash;leastways th&rsquo; wan part o&rsquo; him?&nbsp; Fer
shame, Joe!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis traipsin&rsquo; about i&rsquo; all
they heathen countries, I reckons, as has spiled ye!&nbsp; Ah,
well, well-a-day!&nbsp; There they be, lightin&rsquo; up at
th&rsquo; Thatchers!&nbsp; Coom along, Tom Clemmer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Three squares of red shone out amidst the twinkling dust of
the street, denoting the <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>curtained windows of the inn.&nbsp;
It was the signal for which all had been waiting, and a general
stir took place in the assembly.&nbsp; At length none remained
about me but the old seaman.&nbsp; He had said nothing while the
dismemberment of the group was in progress, but had sat shaking
in silent merriment.&nbsp; Now he, too, got slowly to his
feet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis wunnerful,&rsquo; he observed, moving away,
&lsquo;real onaccountable, th&rsquo; little simple things as some
folks wunt b&rsquo;lieve.&nbsp; There be a thing now,
as&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>But this story of partitioned, yet still living humanity, even
though it came from America, was too much also for me; and I told
him so.&nbsp; He stopped in his easy saunter towards the inn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis trew!&rsquo; he averred as stoutly as
ever.&nbsp; His rich, oily chuckle came over to me through the
darkness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mind ye!&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t say as
th&rsquo; man wur sawed into two ekal parts: &rsquo;twur but
th&rsquo; thumb av him as wur taken off.&nbsp; Belike I&rsquo;ll
jest step acrost to th&rsquo; Thatchers now, an&rsquo; tell that
to Dan&rsquo;l.&rsquo;</p>

210</span>SEPTEMBER</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> holiday-makers in
Windlecombe are mainly of the normal, obvious kind, the people
for whom guide-books and picture postcards are produced, and by
whom the job-masters and the boat proprietors gain a
livelihood.&nbsp; But September brings to the village a wandering
crew of an altogether different complexion.&nbsp; There is
something about the temperate sunshine and general slowing up and
sweetening of life during this month, that draws from their
hiding-nooks in the city suburbs a class of man and woman for
whom I have long entertained the profoundest respect.&nbsp; With
every year, as soon as September comes round, I find myself
looking out for these stray, for the most part solitary, folk,
and, in quite a humble, unpretentious spirit, taking them beneath
my avuncular wing.</p>
<p>That they seek the quiet of an inland village in September,
and not the feverish, belated distractions of the seaside town,
is an initial point in their favour.&nbsp; But almost invariably
they <a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>bring with them a much more subtle
recommendation.&nbsp; They are down for a holiday, but they have
come entirely without premeditation.&nbsp; Suddenly yielding to a
sort of migratory impulse, they have locked up dusty chambers, or
left small shops to the care of wives, or begged a few precious
days from niggardly employers; and come away on a spate of
emotional longing for country quiet and greenery, irresistible
this time, though generally the impulse has been felt and
resisted every autumn for twenty years back.&nbsp; Indeed, there
must be some specially fatal quality about this period of time,
for I constantly hear the same story&mdash;no holiday taken for
twenty years.</p>
<p>At noon to-day, after a long tramp through the fields, I came
up the village street, and paused irresolutely outside the Three
Thatchers Inn.&nbsp; The morning had been hot, and the walk
tiring; moreover, it was the first of September, and the guns had
been popping distressfully in all the coverts by the way.&nbsp; I
knew that before sundown a brace or two of partridges would be
certain to find their road to my door; but this did not prove,
and never has proved, compensation for the flurry and disturbance
carried by the noise of the guns into all my favourite
conning-places, or arenas for quiet thought.&nbsp; The whole
world of wild life was in a panic, and I with it.</p>
<p><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>The
red-ochred doorstep of the inn glowed in the sunshine at my feet,
and from the cool darkness beyond came a chink of glasses and
murmur of many tongues.&nbsp; It all seemed eminently consolatory
for the moment&rsquo;s mood.&nbsp; Within there, no one would
fire a gun off at my ear, nor stalk past me with a shoulder-load
of limp, sanguinary spoil, nor warn me out of my favourite
coppices with a finger to the lip, as though a nation of babies
slumbered within.&nbsp; I was a lost man even before I began to
hesitate.&nbsp; I stood my stout furze walking-stick in the porch
beside a drover&rsquo;s staff, a shepherd&rsquo;s crook, and
three or four undenominational cudgels; and plunged down the two
steps into the bar.</p>
<p>Now, before my eyes had accustomed themselves to the subdued
light, and I could see what company was about me, I had become
aware of a strange odour in the air.&nbsp; It was the scent of a
tobacco, happily unknown in Windlecombe: neither wholly Latakia
nor Turkish, not honeydew alone nor red Virginia, cavendish nor
returns, but a curious internecine blend of all these.&nbsp; I
knew it at once to be something for which I have a constitutional
loathing&mdash;one of the new town mixtures, wherein are confused
and mutually stultified all the good smoking-weeds in the
world.</p>
<p>Looking more narrowly about me, after the <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>usual
greetings, I discovered a vast and elaborate meerschaum pipe in
the corner, and behind it a little diffident smiling man.&nbsp;
But this could not entirely account for the overpowering exotic
reek in the room.&nbsp; I missed the familiar smell of our own
good Windlecombe shag, although there were half a dozen other
pipes in full blast round me.&nbsp; And then I realised the
situation.&nbsp; The stranger had seduced all the company to his
pestilent combination; and now, as I lowered at him through the
haze, he was holding out his pouch even to me, who would not have
touched his garbage if it had been the last pipe-fill left on
earth.&nbsp; But he took my curt, almost surly refusal as if it
were an intended kindness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you do not smoke?&nbsp; Well: it does seem a kind
of insult to the pure country air.&nbsp; But in towns, you know,
what with the din and the dust, and the strain on one&rsquo;s
nerves, everybody&mdash;&nbsp; And of course I must not quarrel
with my bread-and-butter!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I produced my own pipe and pouch, and filled brutally under
his very nose.&nbsp; Serenely he watched the operation, and
without a trace of offence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am in the trade, as I was telling these gentlemen
here when you came in.&nbsp; Do you know the Walworth Road, in
London?&nbsp; My shop is just behind the Elephant, and any day
you are <a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>passing, I&mdash;&nbsp; But wasn&rsquo;t I glad to get
away, if only for the few hours!&nbsp; And I do assure you, sir,
I haven&rsquo;t been out of London for
nearly&mdash;nearly&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twenty years, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me in placid surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lor&rsquo;, how did you know that now?&nbsp; But it is
quite true.&nbsp; Being single-handed, you see, it isn&rsquo;t
easy to&mdash;&nbsp; But I was glad, I tell you!&nbsp; And I had
never seen a real country village in my life, until I got out of
the train at Stavisham and walked on here.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it
quiet!&nbsp; And how funny it seems&mdash;no asphalt-paving, and
no wires running all ways over the house-tops, and the
singing-birds all loose in the trees!&nbsp; And flowers!&nbsp; I
suppose there is a law to prevent people picking &rsquo;em: there
were no end along by the road I came.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somehow my heart warmed to this inconsiderable by-product of
civilisation that had strayed amongst us; and presently, as much
to my own surprise as his, I found myself loitering down the hill
again, with him at my elbow, having promised to show him that
there were other flowers in the country beside the dust-throttled
daisies and dandelions of the roadside.</p>
<p>We took the path that runs between the river and the
wood.&nbsp; He soon let his pipe go out, for he moved in
open-mouthed wonder all the way, <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>which rendered smoking
impracticable.&nbsp; At last we came to a bend in the river,
where the bank sloped gently down to the water-side covered with
all the rich-hued September growths, and we sat down to
rest.&nbsp; I did not plague him with the names of things, nor
with any talk at all; but lay, for the most part silently,
watching the effect of the place upon him, as one might study the
demeanour of a dormouse let loose amidst the like surroundings,
straight from Ratcliff Highway.</p>
<p>He took off coat and hat, and sat quite still for awhile with
legs drawn up, and his chin upon his knees.&nbsp; But presently
he fell to wandering about like a child, ducking his pallid bald
head over each flower as he came to it, but keeping his itching
fingers resolutely clasped behind his back.&nbsp; It was a brave
show, even for this brave time of year.&nbsp; Though other months
afford perhaps a greater variety in colour and kind, Nature in
early autumn seems more forceful and impressive because she
concentrates her energies into the dealing of the one blow, the
urging of the one appeal upon the colour sense.&nbsp; It was the
Purple Month.&nbsp; Look where we would, the same royal colour
filled the sunshine.&nbsp; Purple loosestrife edged the river,
and purple knapweed, thistles, heather, purple thyme and
willowherb and climbing vetch hemmed us in on every side.&nbsp;
<a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>Paler of
hue, yet still of the same regal dye, the wild mint and
cranesbill, marjoram and calamint, crowded upon one another; and
close to the water&rsquo;s edge, the Michaelmas daisies were
already in full flower&mdash;under both banks the soil was tinged
with their pure cool lilac, mirrored again yet more faintly in
the drowsy water below.</p>
<p>For half an hour, perhaps, the little tobacconist wandered up
and down this enchanted place; and then he came back to me,
treading on tiptoe, hushed, and solemn-eyed, as if he were in
church.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You live hereabouts?&rsquo; he asked, in a voice little
above a whisper, &lsquo;all the year round, don&rsquo;t
you?&nbsp; And nothing to do but just put on a hat whenever you
want to come here, and in ten minutes here you are!&nbsp; Nothing
to pay, and no trouble.&nbsp; Oh, my stars!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it is not always the same, you know.&nbsp; I pass
this way nearly every week, and there is always something
different.&nbsp; The flowers change with every month.&nbsp; You
hear different birds singing, according to the season.&nbsp; The
leaves on the trees come and go, and the sky shows you a new
picture every time you look at it.&nbsp; Even the river
changes.&nbsp; It is the top of the tide now: that log, floating
out there, has not moved a dozen feet in the last five
minutes.&nbsp; But in an hour&rsquo;s time the water will be
driving down swift and strong, and all the reeds and rushes, that
<a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>now
stand up quite straight and still in the sunshine, will bending
and trembling in the flow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;&nbsp; He crowded a perfectly bewildering
variety of emotions into the breathed monosyllable.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Is that a nightingale singing over there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; you are too late for nightingales: they have done
singing these two months and more.&nbsp; That is a robin.&nbsp;
The robins have just begun to sing again after their summer
silence; and when that happens, you know the summer is almost
done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He sat now mute at my side for so long, that at last I must
steal a glance at him.&nbsp; I saw him brush a hand hastily
across his eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I am glad I came, of course,&rsquo; said he,
musing, &lsquo;but&mdash;but I have been the worst kind of fool
all the same.&nbsp; Just think of going back there
to-night!&nbsp; Lor&rsquo;! just think of it!&nbsp; Yesterday
morning I watered the geraniums in the window-boxes, and gave the
canary his seed; and, says I, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s singing-birds
and flowers, as good as any you&rsquo;ll get in the
country!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I went to the shop door, and saw a
cart full of straw going by, and another of green cabbages for
Boro&rsquo; Market.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lor&rsquo;!&rdquo; I says,
&ldquo;the country comes on wheels to your very door in
London!&nbsp; London for me!&rdquo;&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;ll
never get that <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>feeling back again, no, never!&nbsp; The very worst
kind of fool, I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> think!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Close by us there grew a great tuft of valerian.&nbsp; As he
sat staring tragically at its disc of deep red blossom,
butterflies came to it with every moment, sipped awhile, then
passed on.&nbsp; Painted ladies, red admirals, little
tortoiseshells always in twos or threes; finally a peacock
butterfly sailed over to the valerian and settled there, her rich
colours aflare in the sunshine.&nbsp; She spread out her great
vanes, the upper covering the lower.&nbsp; Then she gently slid
her upper wings forward, and gradually the wonderful spots on the
lower wings appeared, like a pair of slowly opening, drowsy,
violet eyes.&nbsp; The little tobacconist breathed hard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can see it all clear enough,&rsquo; he said
tremulously.&nbsp; &lsquo;A man gets a real chance here.&nbsp;
Come worry, come sickness, come bad luck, come anything you
like&mdash;all you have got to do is to open your eyes and ears,
and off it goes like the bundle of sins in the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i> book.&nbsp; But in London&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; He
stopped short; then, in a tone of deep, despairing disgust,
&lsquo;Geraniums!&mdash;Canaries!&mdash;Cartloads of cabbages!
bah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had not found myself confronted by so difficult a
proposition for many a long day.&nbsp; If only the Reverend had
been there!&nbsp; But there was <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>nothing for it but to try a joust
with the situation alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Depend upon it,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if coming amongst
the beautiful natural things of the world has made you despise
the mean, ugly, necessary parts of your life, then you have been
a fool indeed&mdash;one of the worst kind.&nbsp; But are you
really the sort of fool you think?&nbsp; And have you not
overstated both cases alike?&nbsp; In neither town nor country is
there all of good, or all of evil.&nbsp; There are plenty of
geraniums and cabbages in Windlecombe,
and&mdash;alas!&mdash;canaries.&nbsp; And in London there is
plenty of beauty, if you look for it with the right
eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beauty?&mdash;in London?&rsquo; he repeated
incredulously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, truly; and the people who see it, and enjoy it
most, are just those people who have the deepest knowledge of,
and love for, the natural things of the country-side.&nbsp; Now,
shall I tell you what sort of a fool you really are?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He thought a moment, eyeing me in some perplexity.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well&mdash;yes,&rsquo; said he at last, &lsquo;if it
isn&rsquo;t too much trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a lot of trouble, and I am not sure I can do
it.&nbsp; But I will try.&nbsp; Did you ever hear of the saying,
&ldquo;Where ignorance is bliss, &rsquo;tis folly to be
wise?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No: I can&rsquo;t say that I ever&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>&lsquo;Well, you have fallen right into that
trap.&nbsp; You have given yourself twenty years of that kind of
bliss, and now you have got to pay for it.&nbsp; But what was it
made you start off this morning in such a hurry to get to the
country, when only yesterday you were quite content with your
window-boxes and your screeching yellow gewgaw?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He considered a little, then blushed to his eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was an old book,&rsquo; he said mysteriously,
looking round apparently to make certain we were alone,
&lsquo;nothing but an old book on a bookstall.&nbsp; I picked it
up just out of curiosity as I went by last night, and there were
some dried flowers in it&mdash;dog-roses, I think.&nbsp; And then
I looked up and saw the moon shining very small and bright high
up in the sky; and it came over me that though she kept one eye
dutifully on the Walworth Road, with the other eye she might well
be looking down on the country lane where those roses grew years
ago.&nbsp; And thinks I, all of a creep, like, Why can&rsquo;t a
man look two ways at once; and if he must give one eye to
business, why can&rsquo;t he give the other to just what he
likes?&nbsp; And then I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then you certainly left off being the kind of fool
I mean&mdash;left off for ever.&nbsp; Well: that saves us both a
lot of trouble, for we are both <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>wrong about your case, it
seems.&nbsp; You need not fear to go home to-night.&nbsp; You
will find those geraniums as fresh and sweet as the valerian
there, and just as populous of butterflies.&nbsp; And the
canary&mdash;you will hear in his song every morning the notes of
all the wild birds that have sung to you to-day.&nbsp; And when
next a wagonload of straw goes by your shop, it will not be mere
straw, but a field of wheat under the country sunshine: the sound
of the wind in the Walworth telephone wires will be for you only
the rustle of wind in the corn.&nbsp; That is what I meant by
London beauty.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>That summer is drawing to its end, and autumn close at hand,
one need not look at the calendar to know.&nbsp; Throughout a
morning&rsquo;s walk, signs of imminent change crop up now at
every turn.&nbsp; The wild arums that you have forgotten since
last you saw them turning their pale green cowls from the light,
give out a bold glitter of scarlet in the shady deeps under every
hedgerow.&nbsp; Each day sees the hips and haws growing
ruddier.&nbsp; Though September is scarce half gone, the green
bracken-fronds in the woods are already alight at the tips with
crimson and gold; and the heather on the combe-side has lost its
<a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>clear
rose-red.&nbsp; The song of the bees in it seems as loud as ever,
but for every tuft of living blossom there are two that are faded
and brown.&nbsp; The good times are nearly over for the
honey-makers, and each day the gathering of a full load of nectar
means travelling farther afield.</p>
<p>I wonder why it is I always look forward to the renewal of the
year&rsquo;s life with so much eagerness and impatience, and yet
meet its decline with such surpassing equanimity.&nbsp; Am
I&mdash;I have often asked myself lately&mdash;the same being who
industriously searched the river bank for a whole bleak February
morning in quest of the first coltsfoot, greeting it with an
unconscionable extravagance of rejoicing: I who now tread the
same way in nowise perturbed, nor even unelated, at the obvious
fact of each day&rsquo;s lessened ardour?&nbsp; The truth that
the year is already on the long downward road, riding for its
winter fall, awakens in me not a pang of regret.&nbsp; Indeed, I
neither remember the departed magnificence of June as something
lost, nor regard the ever-diminishing September days as portent
of penurious times to come.&nbsp; With autumn, as with advancing
age, when once each is assured, irrevocable, the natural tendency
seems to be towards a looking neither backward nor forward, but
towards a joyful acceptance of the things that are.&nbsp; And so,
at these times, whatever our <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>declared principles, we one and all
develop, or degenerate, into optimists.</p>
<p>But, of a truth, it needs very little of this mental condiment
to be happy in a Sussex Downland village in September.&nbsp;
Perhaps none but the very old can, at any time, sincerely avow a
repugnance towards machinery in farming: certainly, at this
season of the year, the whole spirit of village life receives
benefit from it.&nbsp; They have been threshing up at the farm
to-day, and from sunrise to sunset, all through the still, quiet,
golden hours, the voice of the threshing mill has permeated
everything, blent itself with the song of the robins in the
garden, with the chime from the smithy, with all the other sounds
of labour that go to make up the silence of country
dwelling-places.&nbsp; I have come to look upon this sound as the
veritable keynote of autumn, and to believe that it has an
influence on all hearts at this season, entirely underrated by
those whose business it is to study rural affairs.</p>
<p>It is the fashion to contemn the old melodramatic trick of
still-music; but, for my own part, I have never been able to
resist the low sobbing and sighing of the violins when the
stage-story is being cleared up, all wrongs righted, and the
villain given his due.&nbsp; The speech itself is nothing to
me.&nbsp; It is seldom regarded, and remembered never.&nbsp; I
should be just as deeply <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>moved if all that leashed, melodious
passion went as setting to &lsquo;Old Mother Hubbard&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.&rsquo;&nbsp; And on the
same principle, when this beautiful, solemn voice of the
threshing mill dwells in the autumnal air, I find myself doing
the commonest things with a sense of high Fate and speeding of
the world&rsquo;s progress.&nbsp; But, indeed, Nature works
throughout largely on this still-music plan, and therein lies one
inestimable advantage of living in the country.&nbsp; Bird song,
to all intents and purposes, unceasing throughout the
year&mdash;the songs of stream, river, and sea&mdash;the songs of
the four winds&mdash;all work together for good on the hearts of
those men and women who, by their own design, or by external
destiny, have been led to keep their thread of life running by
green woods and fields.</p>
<p>As the sun went down behind the hills, and left the world
afloat in wine-coloured mist, every sound of work ceased in the
village, save this rich throbbing voice of the threshing mill up
at the farm.&nbsp; I went out into the dreaming light to listen
to it.&nbsp; From where I sat on the churchyard wall, I could
make out that they were prolonging the work into the dusk, so
that the last rick might be finished now, and the threshing gang
move on to-night to the next farm.&nbsp; There was the deep sound
of the mill itself, one <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>tremendous baritone note succeeding
another, each held for a moment, and then suddenly changing to
one higher or lower in the sonorous clef.&nbsp; Apart from this,
I could distinguish the fuss and fume of the engine, as it drove
its white breath in little unsteady gusts up against the violet
calm of the sky.&nbsp; And there was another sound&mdash;the
flapping song of the driving-belt&mdash;a note that punctuated
everything, as though some invisible conductor were beating time
to the general symphony.&nbsp; But the combined effect of all was
infinitely harmonious and restful.</p>
<p>Yet I had come out, in the main, to hear, not this familiar
part of the music, but something about it that I loved to hear
most of all; and this was the stopping of the machine.&nbsp; It
was almost dark before the last sheaf went to the mill, and steam
was shut off.&nbsp; And then the wonderful note began.&nbsp; The
machine took an appreciable time to run down.&nbsp; But now there
was no upward inflection in its voice.&nbsp; Note by note, each
note more drawn out and quieter, the rich tones fell through
every stage of an octave, until at last they died away in the
profoundest, softest bass.&nbsp; Even then I fancied I could feel
the solid earth still shuddering with a music too deep for human
ear.</p>
<h3><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>III</h3>
<p>I think the last of the summer boating parties to Windlecombe
has come and gone; at least for a week I have seen and heard
nothing of revelry.&nbsp; But the thin stream of odd folk still
dribbles into the village from road or Down.</p>
<p>There were two elderly ladies, obviously sisters, wandering
about the place one day, who afforded material for commentary to
most curious tongues.&nbsp; Severely and sparely clad in grey
tweeds, wearing black felt hats each wrapped about with a wisp of
grey gauze, and gold spectacles, over the shining hafts of which
little tight glossy-white ringlets depended, pink serene faces
inclined to be downy, and voices low and gentle yet
extraordinarily penetrating and clear&mdash;they crept about the
village all day long in an ecstasy of enjoyment, peering into
cottage doorways, looking over garden fences, watching the
children at play on the green and the mothers hanging out their
linen, gazing with timorous delight down into the
wheelwright&rsquo;s sawpit, and into the black deeps of Tom
Clemmer&rsquo;s forge.&nbsp; And all the while, though they kept
up an incessant low interchange between themselves, they accosted
no one.&nbsp; Apparently Windlecombe was to them a sort of
spectacle, half peep-show and half <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>menagerie, where everything might be
looked at, but nothing touched.&nbsp; The last I saw of them,
they were standing at the far end of the green, looking towards
the seats under the Seven Sisters where two old rustics slumbered
peacefully in the sun.&nbsp; The pair were in earnest
consultation, and obvious, though wholly affectionate difference
on some point.&nbsp; At length one, apparently the more ancient
by a year or two, raised her hands with a gesture of reluctant
consent.&nbsp; And then the other timidly approached the old men,
presented each with what, at a distance, appeared to be a surplus
sandwich drawn from a reticule, and returned to her companion,
giving her&mdash;before they made off down the street
together&mdash;a grateful, childish little hug.</p>
<p>On another day a very different pair dropped down from the
skies amongst us.&nbsp; They were two men scarcely of middle age,
the one with a swirl of coppery hair topping a high forehead, the
other sombre-locked, low-browed and swarthy; both alike shabby,
unshaven and unkempt.&nbsp; They came swinging down the hill-path
together, hatless and barefooted, laden up with certain dusty
travelling-gear, the one of them carrying in addition a
leather-cased violin.&nbsp; As they strode through the village
street they made the place resound with their laughter, jovially
greeted all and sundry that chanced in their way, <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>and finally
disappeared through the door of the Three Thatchers Inn.</p>
<p>Thereafter, sitting at work by the window, I forgot all about
them, until a far-off strain of music gradually forced itself
upon my ear.&nbsp; I could make out the violin, played as though
it were three instruments at least, and above it such a voice as
I had heard only once in my life before.&nbsp; I saw that
passers-by were halting in the roadway to listen.&nbsp; Some were
crowded round the inn window, craning over one another&rsquo;s
heads.&nbsp; Then the music stopped, the pair of harmonious
vagabonds reappeared, and made straight for the Seven Sisters,
all the folk jostling at their heels.&nbsp; A moment later, the
violin struck into an air that sent my pen clattering to the
paper, and my feet speeding towards the house-door.&nbsp; It was
the &lsquo;X&mdash;,&rsquo; the tenor song from
&lsquo;Q&mdash;,&rsquo; played by a master hand.&nbsp; Before I
reached the fringe of the little crowd&mdash;taking the old vicar
by the arm as I went&mdash;the copper-haired man had mounted upon
the seat and had begun to sing the incomparable melody, hurling
it over the heads of the crowd with a passion, a force, yet with
a surpassingly delicate sweetness of tone, that drew the people
spellbound closer and closer with every moment round him.&nbsp;
The old parson&rsquo;s grip tightened on my sleeve.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is he like?&rsquo; he whispered.&nbsp; And when <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>I had told
him&mdash;&lsquo;Strange that he should come here
and&mdash;&nbsp; But there can be few with a voice like that: it
must be&mdash;&nbsp; Ah! listen!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know
now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>For the song had changed.&nbsp; The violin had slowed down
into a simple quiet undertone.&nbsp; And then there pealed out
upon us an air that a year ago had been made famous by one man
alone, and he almost the greatest in his art.&nbsp; As he sang,
his great chest heaving in the sunshine, I watched him, and once
he looked swiftly in our direction.&nbsp; He gave us the whole
piece, that finishes on a note incredibly high, yet is not really
an end to the song, for the note is one picked out, as it were,
at random in the scale.&nbsp; Then, to my amazement, he got down
from the bench, took the hat from the head of the nearest boy,
and went gravely about among the folk, collecting pennies.&nbsp;
From me he levied toll as from the rest, but instead of holding
out the hat to the Reverend, he placed it, money and all, into
his hands, adding to the goodly store a shining piece from his
own pocket.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will know what to do with it,&rsquo;
said he, his grey eyes twinkling merrily.</p>
<p>A minute later the pair were trudging off together down the
street, as they had come, with their dusty, travel-stained
satchels swinging behind them, and their long hair blowing in the
breeze.</p>
<h3><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>IV</h3>
<p>Yes, the summer is gone, in very truth.&nbsp; With every day
now, and every hour of the day, the writing on the wall shows
plainer.&nbsp; While the hushed, hot times endured, it was still
possible to believe red autumn as far away as ever; for not a
leaf in oak or elm has changed, nor will change, perhaps, for
weeks to come.&nbsp; But the tell-tale winds of the equinox are
upon us, bringing the very voice of autumn with them; and the
acorns are falling by the river, and the thistle-down drifting
white upon the hills.</p>
<p>I began this day badly&mdash;badly, that is to say, from my
own private point of view; which is a point, it may well be, like
Euclid&rsquo;s, having position but no dimensions, yet a point
nevertheless.&nbsp; Chancing to wake with the dawn, I saw that
the day was beginning with a beautiful smoke-pearl trellis in the
east, behind which welled up an ever-strengthening fountain of
silver white.&nbsp; Coming presently out upon the green under
this pure pale glow of morning, I was startled by a cry that came
echoing from the misty twilight of the hills.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hi-up!&nbsp; Hi-up!&nbsp; Voller, voller,
voller!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hoarse, harsh, undeniably brutal it sounded in the sweet,
snow-white lustre of the virgin light.&nbsp; And then came the
shrill blare of the <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>huntsman&rsquo;s horn, the confused
yelping and baying of the pack, and the dull thunder of beating
hoofs, as the hunt drove over the hill-top, and fell to drawing
Windle coverts.</p>
<p>At once the silent village awoke.&nbsp; Windows were thrown
open and heads appeared.&nbsp; Dark figures burst from cottage
doors and went pounding up the lane that led to the hills.&nbsp;
Round the covert the horsemen gathered in a motionless ring,
while the huntsman drove his pack through the undergrowth, for
ever urging them forward with that fierce guttural note, which
was more like the cry of a wolf than a man.&nbsp; At length a
fine cub fox broke cover, and led the whole company a ding-dong
chase over the hills, and out of sight and hearing for good.</p>
<p>Some hours later, I met Farmer Coles and his two sons
returning from the sport, the youngest, a mere schoolboy, mounted
on a pony, his head, as he rode, reaching scarce to his
father&rsquo;s saddle-peak.&nbsp; He was in huge high spirits,
displaying the brush, his share of the spoil, to all acquaintance
as he passed.&nbsp; And the face of this yellow-haired, chubby
child was bedaubed with blood, thick zebra-like streaks of it
smudged across his smooth forehead and rosy baby cheeks.&nbsp; He
was going home delighted, to show to an admiring mother how he
had been &lsquo;blooded&rsquo; at his first cub-hunt; and in all
that country-side, I thought <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>to myself as I passed on, there was
scarce a man or woman of station and breeding who would not have
applauded son of theirs returning home in such a plight.</p>
<p>Nor, though at the time the thing filled me personally with
genuine horror and loathing, did I condemn it, nor wish to see
its like made impossible in the land.&nbsp; For the sybaritish,
lotus-eating danger is too imminent in our midst for any such
fabian trifling: it will be a woeful day for England when we have
bred out of our young manhood the last instincts of the healthy
brute.</p>
<p>I got into Runridge&rsquo;s skiff, in the absence of its
owner, and pushed off into mid-stream, letting the little craft
drift whither it would.&nbsp; Wind and tide together were setting
strongly up-country.&nbsp; Swiftly the reedy banks glided by, as
we bore through the meadows that lie at the foot of the
hills.&nbsp; The summer was gone, indeed; and gone with it that
sense of striving towards achievement.&nbsp; The year seemed to
be resting upon its oars, as I was doing.&nbsp; All its fruit was
set: there remained nothing now but to wait and let it
ripen.&nbsp; It was just this waiting and resting that made up
autumn&rsquo;s greatest charm.</p>
<p>I set my elbows on my knees and my chin on my hands, and let
the little boat choose a destiny for the idle pair of us.&nbsp;
The bank was high to windward.&nbsp; We drifted in an almost
unruffled <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>calm, while overhead there sailed by an unending cloud
of thistle-down, tiny verticals of sunlit silver, each gleaming
star-like against the morning blue.&nbsp; Most of them took the
broad river at a stride, disappearing over the opposite bank, but
many fell upon the water.&nbsp; Thousands of them floated around
me, and as far as eye could reach the water was grey and misty
with them.&nbsp; And this was only one nook of earth in
innumerable miles.&nbsp; How was it, I asked of the wind above
me, that with such inexhaustible store of thistle-seed, she could
not sow the whole land thick with thistles in a single season,
and drive all other things from the fields?&nbsp; The answer was
to be obtained for the mere raising of a hand.&nbsp; For it is
not the thistle-seed that flies, but only the harmless
thistle-down.&nbsp; Moreover, among the millions of air-ships
that each thistle-patch sends off upon the wind throughout a
breezy autumn day, not one in fifty ever bore a seed, or, if
bearing it, contrived to carry its burden more than a yard or
two.&nbsp; The curved seed-pod of the thistle is attached to its
feathery volute only by the slenderest thread, and is brushed off
by the lightest touch of the first grass-blade as it sails low
over the sward.&nbsp; But the thistle-down, lightened of its
counterpoise, bowls on for ever.</p>
<h2><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>OCTOBER</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> each October in every year for
a long time past, I have watched for the going of the martins,
but have never yet contrived to witness the moment of their
flight.&nbsp; It has always happened in the same way.&nbsp; One
day they have been as busy as ever about the roof-eaves, their
chattering song pervading the house unceasingly from dark to
dark.&nbsp; And then a morning comes, generally towards the end
of the first week in the month, when I awaken to a curious sense
of strangeness and loss.&nbsp; First I mark the unwonted silence
outside the windows, and then I guess what has come about.&nbsp;
Looking forth, I see that the little mud-houses, huddled together
in a long row under the eaves, are deserted and silent at
last.</p>
<p>But to-day, though I missed the departure of the martins as
usual, I was not wholly disappointed.&nbsp; Getting up in the new
silence and throwing the windows back, I looked along the
roof-edge.&nbsp; Save for the chippering and fluttering <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>of a few
sparrows, there was nothing to be seen or heard in the dim grey
light.&nbsp; But it seemed the little army could have been away
only a few minutes before me, for while I looked, I saw the last
of them depart.&nbsp; One single note of the remembered song
broke out overhead; there was a whir of wings, and the little
black-and-white bird lanced straight off, going due south
unhesitatingly, as though the vanished throng of her companions
was yet visible far away in the skies.</p>
<p>It was a still, grey, warm morning.&nbsp; There had been no
dew.&nbsp; Everything, as presently I went along by the
wood-side, was quite dry; and though it was barely eight
o&rsquo;clock, all the spiders in the bushes were hard at work
weaving their snares.&nbsp; It was almost perfect spinning
weather.&nbsp; On windy mornings, though the webs must be made,
the task is difficult and the work seldom properly carried
out.&nbsp; But to-day there was only a vague air moving from the
south-west, and all the spiders had got to work betimes, and with
light hearts.</p>
<p>The great charm in all nature study is to find out the truth
for yourself at first hand.&nbsp; There are few things in my life
I regret so keenly as the reading of nature books.&nbsp; This has
robbed me of many a moment of pleasurable surprise; for to
recognise a commonly accepted fact is <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>poor substitute for its original
discovery, although this discovery may have been made by others a
thousand times before.&nbsp; Looking back over twenty
years&rsquo; poking and prying in the woods and fields round
about Windlecombe, I rejoice not so much at the many things I
have found out, but at the fact of so many things still unread
of, and still remaining to be discovered.&nbsp; This morning, as
I went along by the bushes in the lee of the wood, and saw the
spiders at work, it suddenly occurred to me that I knew little or
nothing about them; and the recognition of this ignorance came to
me as truest bliss.&nbsp; I fell to looking on at the ingenious,
complicated work with almost as much anxiety and interest as the
male spiders themselves.</p>
<p>For it appears to be only the female who spins a web.&nbsp;
The big-bodied spider, so industriously occupied in every gap of
the thicket, is always the female, though the male is never far
off.&nbsp; You are sure to find him peering out from under one of
the adjacent leaves, or treading timidly on the circumference of
the web, trying to attract the attention, and thereafter,
perhaps, the regard of its maker.</p>
<p>Spider nets and their weavers have, I think, never been given
quite their place in the world of wonders.&nbsp; As far as human
profit is concerned, spiders are useless things; and have
therefore <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>missed, because, from that standpoint, they have not
merited, popular favour.&nbsp; But no doubt their ingenuity as
craftswomen stands very nearly on a level with that of the worker
honey-bee.&nbsp; The waxen comb of the bee, whose perfection is
due to the combined arts of engineer, mason, and geometrician, is
very little superior in design and carrying-out to the
spider&rsquo;s web.</p>
<p>On these still, grey autumn mornings, the tendency of the eye
is not to wander far afield, but to concern itself with the
little things of the wayside close at hand; and so, more than at
any other time of year, perhaps, the spiders and their ways come
in for narrow scrutiny.&nbsp; And here is something, in the first
loving investigation of which the uninformed, unread observer is
much to be envied.</p>
<p>He notices in the outset that these fine silken snares, hung
by the spiders in the hedgerows, are of two kinds&mdash;the one
placed vertically across a gap in the surface of the thicket; the
other placed horizontally, closing up some shaft or upward
passage-way in the heart of the green bush.&nbsp; The vertical
net is seen to be composed of a number of threads radiating from
a common centre, and upon these threads an ever-increasing spiral
line has been laid, forming a regular, meshed net.&nbsp; But the
horizontal web has none of this geometric neatness.&nbsp; It is a
mere expanse <a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>of fine tissue irregularly woven into a sort of crazy
pattern, and slung hammock fashion, completely closing the
chimney-like hollow wherein it has been made.&nbsp; From a view
of the finished webs, two other facts will be noted&mdash;the
vertical net is supported only by lines springing from its
circumference, and the spider sits at its centre in front; the
horizontal net is suspended by numberless fine lines attached at
all points in its upper surface, while the spider clings to the
under side as she lies in wait for her prey.</p>
<p>But it is in the actual weaving of the nets that the interest
of the onlooker will be chiefly centred.&nbsp; The maker of the
vertical, or cartwheel, pattern of web begins operations in
various ways, according to the conditions imposed upon her by the
weather and the spot she has selected.&nbsp; Webs made in calm
seasons, or when only light airs are stirring, will have few
mainstays, and these may be of considerable length; but in windy
times the spider will stretch her snare on only short hawsers,
using as many as may be necessary to make assurance doubly
sure.&nbsp; But in either case she will commence the work in much
the same way.</p>
<p>First she goes to the highest point on the windward side of
her gap, and turning her head to the current, begins to pay out a
line behind her.&nbsp; As this floats out, she continually tries
it with her <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>leg until she knows that the end of the line has caught
in the opposite twigs.&nbsp; Then she runs to the middle of this
horizontal line, dragging after her another thread which she has
previously attached to her original starting-point.&nbsp; From
the centre of the first line she lowers herself vertically,
always dragging the second line in her rear, until she reaches a
twig below.&nbsp; Here she draws her second line tight and
fastens it, after which she climbs to the horizontal line and
repeats the man&oelig;uvre, only this time from its leeward
end.&nbsp; Thus the triangle of mainstays&mdash;the first
essential in all spider-web making&mdash;is complete.</p>
<p>The weaving of the net within this triangular frame is the
next work undertaken.&nbsp; The spider, when she first dropped
from the centre of her uppermost thread, made a vertical line in
descending.&nbsp; Some point on this line marks the centre of the
future cartwheel pattern of web, and this central point the
spider now finds unerringly, and begins to put in one by one the
radiating spokes of the wheel.&nbsp; When all these spokes are in
place, she returns to the centre, and revolving her body quickly,
she forms upon it a close spiral of four or five turns.&nbsp;
This is to be her seat and watch-tower, whence she will keep the
whole web under observation.&nbsp; Having done this, she
now&mdash;if the morning is at all breezy&mdash;carries <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>temporary
stay-lines from spoke to spoke all round the web, these isolated
circles of thread occurring at intervals of an inch or so between
centre and circumference.&nbsp; But on still mornings this part
of her work is omitted as unnecessary, and she proceeds at once
to the main spinning of the net.</p>
<p>The construction of the cross-threads between the spokes of
the web is always commenced at the extreme outer edges of the
space to be filled; and the spider works inwardly, carrying the
thread round and round from spoke to spoke until she arrives
within half an inch or so of the central small spiral.&nbsp; But
the two are never joined: an interval is always left where the
web consists of nothing but bare radiating lines.&nbsp; The snare
is now finished.&nbsp; The spider takes up her station in the
middle of the net, with no more to do for the rest of the day but
take what fair chance, and her own crafty ingenuity, may
provide.</p>
<p>Yet, having thus watched the making of a spider-web from start
to finish, and having noted all the details of construction here
set down, there is something more about the matter which, if it
escape the observer, will leave him in the rather disgraceful
plight of having missed the most wonderful thing of all.</p>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s snare is not woven throughout of <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>the same
kind of thread.&nbsp; Two kinds are used, and the difference
between them is apparent even to eyes of very moderate
power.&nbsp; While the triangle and the radiating lines are made
of plain silk, the cross-threads are corrugated, and look like
strings of tiny, transparent beads.&nbsp; A touch of the finger
will prove that these beads are really adhering drops of some
glutinous fluid, whose use is not difficult to guess.&nbsp; But
how do the beads get on the line, seeing that this, when first
drawn from the spider&rsquo;s body, is visibly nothing but a
plain filament of silk, like the rest of the web?</p>
<p>The question has been asked many times, and the answer
commonly given is, I have come to believe, an entirely erroneous
one.&nbsp; We are told that the thread used for the cross-bars in
a spider&rsquo;s web, when it first emerges from the
creature&rsquo;s body, is only smeared, not beaded with the
gluten; but that after attaching each segment of the spiral to
the spokes, the spider gives it a twang with her foot, thus
causing the gluten to separate into beads.&nbsp; Here then is a
fact such as one would read in the nature books, and
unquestionably accept.&nbsp; But a little independent experiment
with various kinds of strings, elastic or non-elastic, and
smeared with different glutinous substances, reveals the fact
that no amount of twanging will induce the latter to <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>divide into
beads, such as one sees in the spider line.&nbsp; In every case,
the tendency of the gluten in the experiment is to fly off
altogether, or to gather to one side of the string.</p>
<p>But to any that desires to know the truth of the thing, the
spider herself will speedily resolve the difficulty.&nbsp; Watch
her at work, and it will soon be seen that the beads are formed
on the line not by twanging, but by stretching.&nbsp; At the
moment each length of sticky thread is drawn from the
spider&rsquo;s spinnerets, it is destitute of beads.&nbsp; But
the spider quickly stretches it out to nearly double its original
length, and then as quickly slackens it; whereupon, before she
has well had time to fasten the thread in its place, the beads
will be seen to have formed themselves throughout its entire
length.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Said Miss Susan Angel this evening, as I leant over the
counter of her little dark shop, studying the rows of sweetstuff
bottles beyond: &lsquo;Th&rsquo; chillern here, &rsquo;tis real
astonishin&rsquo; how changeable they be.&nbsp; One time
&rsquo;tis all lickrich wi &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; next &rsquo;tis
all sherbet-suckers, an&rsquo; then maybe &rsquo;tis nought but
toffee-balls for weeks on end.&nbsp; But you!&rsquo;&mdash;she
turned me a glance full of smiling, proud
approbation&mdash;&lsquo;You!&mdash;come <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>winter or
summer, come rain or shine, I allers knaws &rsquo;twill be nobbut
black-fours!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She reached down the ancient glass jar, and stabbed at its
contents ruminatively with an iron fork.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Black-fours&mdash;ah!&rsquo; she mused, as the shining
magpie lumps rattled into the brass scale-pan.&nbsp;
&lsquo;An&rsquo; I never smells &rsquo;em but I thinks o&rsquo;
my ould missus as&mdash;&nbsp; Lorey me! how many long year
ago!&nbsp; Fond on &rsquo;em, wur she?&nbsp; Ah! an&rsquo;
scrunch &rsquo;em up, &rsquo;a could, quicker &rsquo;n e&rsquo;er
wan wi&rsquo; a nateral jaw!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What kind of jaw, then, had she, Susan?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! I believe ye!&nbsp; My dear! th&rsquo; money as ut
costed!&nbsp; All gold, an&rsquo; ivory like, an&rsquo; red
stuff!&nbsp; An&rsquo; when &rsquo;a died&mdash;&nbsp; Did never
I show &rsquo;em to ye?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She disappeared into the little kitchen behind the shop.&nbsp;
I heard a drawer unlocked; there was a sound of rummaging,
accompanied by asthmatic interjections; Miss Susan Angel came
forth again bearing a bulky parcel.&nbsp; This, as she removed
various coverings, became smaller and smaller until, from a final
wrapping of tissue-paper, there appeared a beautiful double set
of false teeth.&nbsp; Miss Angel held them up to my gaze
admiringly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Left &rsquo;em to me, &rsquo;a did!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twur
all writ in her will&mdash;&ldquo;To my faithful servant
an&rsquo; friend, <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>Susan Angel, I give an&rsquo;
bequeath&rdquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; all th&rsquo; rest on
&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Ah! bless her an&rsquo; rest her sowl!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It seemed rather an appropriate legacy, for Miss Angel had
possessed not a single tooth of her own in all the years I had
known her.&nbsp; But the display of the treasure provoked a very
natural commentary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long have you had these put by, Susan?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nigh upon thirty year, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And never used them yourself all that time, although
you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo;&nbsp; The old lady drew herself up, the
youthful blue eyes in her wrinkled face flashing
indignation.&nbsp; &lsquo;What d&rsquo; ye say!&mdash;me use
&rsquo;em?&nbsp; <i>Me</i>?&nbsp; Th&rsquo; very same as my dear
ould missus chawed wi&rsquo;?&nbsp; Shame on ye!&nbsp; Not if
there was nought to eat but cracking-nuts left i&rsquo; th&rsquo;
wureld fer us all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I took the rebuke in penitent silence.&nbsp; When she had
restored the revered relics to their locker in the back room, she
resumed her knitting in the great wicker chair behind the
counter.&nbsp; In a minute or two she had alike forgiven me and
forgotten the cause of her displeasure, as I knew from her
tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How the evenin&rsquo;s do draw in, to be sure!&rsquo;
she observed, laying down her work.&nbsp; &lsquo;A&rsquo;most
dark, ut be, though &rsquo;tis no more &rsquo;n six
o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ancient timepiece in the corner promptly <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>droned out
eleven.&nbsp; Miss Angel clapped her hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did I tell ye?&rsquo; she said triumphantly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wunnerful good time &rsquo;a keeps, when I recollects to
putt un back reg&rsquo;lar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She rose and reversed the hands for a circle or two.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;ll do till mornin&rsquo;,&rsquo; said she
placidly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ye warnts to be a little particler
i&rsquo; country places: ut bean&rsquo;t like i&rsquo; towns
where&mdash;Gipsies! I do believe!&nbsp; An&rsquo; this time
o&rsquo; night, to be sure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I followed her sudden glance to the doorway.&nbsp; A heavy
grinding of wheels had sounded outside, and across our field of
view, silhouetted against the deep turquoise blue of the night,
there passed what looked like a gipsies&rsquo; caravan.&nbsp; A
bony horse toiled in the shafts, and a long lean man walked in
front, dragging at the animal&rsquo;s bridle with almost as much
apparent effort.&nbsp; Lights shone from the windows of the
vehicle, and its chimney smoked voluminously against the
stars.&nbsp; As it went by, we could see another man sitting upon
the steps in its rear, his squat bulky form entirely blocking the
open door-place.&nbsp; The caravan pulled up about midway over
the green.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, that wunt do!&rsquo; observed Miss Angel
decisively.&nbsp; &lsquo;We warnts nane o&rsquo; they sort
traipsing about Windlecombe after dark, <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>leastways
not them as keeps chicken.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis on your road hoame:
jest gie &rsquo;em a wured as you goos by, my dear.&nbsp; Tell
&rsquo;em as you warnts to save trouble fer th&rsquo;
policeman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In nowise intending to disturb the gipsies, I nevertheless
took the short cut over the green, passing in the darkness close
by their queer, spindle-spanked, top-heavy dwelling.&nbsp; As I
cut through the beam of light that poured from the doorway, a
suave voice hailed me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hi! my man!&nbsp; Just a moment!&nbsp; Now, Grewes,
your difficulty is at an end.&nbsp; I have intercepted one of the
inhabitants, and doubtless he will&mdash;&nbsp; Yes: inquire of
him&mdash;very politely now&mdash;where we may obtain
water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The long lean man had blundered into the light beside me,
carrying two pails.&nbsp; He was clothed in little better than
rags from head to foot.&nbsp; A massive gold watch-chain
glittered across his buttonless waistcoat.&nbsp; He turned upon
me two gaunt, diffident eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Water,&rsquo; he hesitated, holding out the pails
helplessly before him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Water, you know!&nbsp; Could
you be so kind as to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The suave, flute-like voice sounded again from the depths of
the caravan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Grewes! if I am to carry out the little supper
scheme I explained to you, no time must be lost.&nbsp; When once
they are peeled, potatoes <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>should never&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; The
owner of the voice appeared in the doorway.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear,
dear!&nbsp; My good fellow! there you are, still standing there;
and I fully impressed it upon you that if rabbit is permitted to
bake one moment longer than&mdash;&nbsp; Grewes! give me those
pails!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the long lean man had drawn me precipitately away.&nbsp;
As we hurried across the green together in the direction of the
well-house, he seemed to consider himself under some necessity of
explanation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is his caravan,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;Spelthorne&rsquo;s, you know.&nbsp; And I am travelling
with him for a bit, because I was run down, and&mdash;and other
things.&nbsp; One of the best fellows breathing, he is, though
you mightn&rsquo;t&mdash;I mean I so often forget what
I&mdash;&nbsp; Of course, I really don&rsquo;t wonder that
sometimes he&mdash;&nbsp; Why! I have forgotten to unharness the
horse!&nbsp; Do remind me&mdash;will you?&mdash;when we get back;
but quietly, you understand?&nbsp; Spelthorne, he is the best
fellow breathing, but&mdash;&nbsp; Oh, is this the well?&nbsp; It
is most kind of you, I&rsquo;m sure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He seemed in so strained and nervous a mood that I did not
trust him to handle the heavy bucket and chain, nor to return
unaided to the caravan with his burden.&nbsp; When we drew into
the beam of light again, I could see Spelthorne inside, stooping
over the little cooking-stove in <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>his shirt-sleeves and a great
sombrero.&nbsp; If anything, his clothes were even more tattered
and soiled than his companion&rsquo;s.&nbsp; At sound of our
clanking pails he turned, stared, then swept me a low bow with
the sombrero.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thoughtless, very thoughtless!&mdash;indeed, most
selfish of Grewes!&rsquo; he said confidentially, for the long
lean man had hurried away to attend to the horse.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
good fellow, such a good fellow, you cannot think!&nbsp; But he
has this little failing of sometimes taking advantage of any
kindness that&mdash;&nbsp; But excuse me: I must get the potatoes
on!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had hardly gone a dozen paces towards home, when I heard him
pounding after me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is&mdash;the name,&rsquo; he asked breathlessly,
&lsquo;of&mdash;of this village?&rsquo;&nbsp; And when I had told
him: &lsquo;There are beautiful old cottages here, are there
not?&nbsp; And quaint people?&nbsp; And charming country round
about?&nbsp; Such a spot&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;where two
artists could find incessant inspiration,
and&mdash;and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the question had been put to me before, and too often.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said I
discouragingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;The place is very quiet and humdrum,
and most inconvenient&mdash;no railway and no roads to anywhere
and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The very place!&rsquo; he broke in delightedly.&nbsp;
<a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>&lsquo;I
shall persuade poor Grewes to remain here with me a
month.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And when I took a last look at the night some hours after, I
beheld the faint glow, from the windows of the caravan upon the
green, with dismal foreboding.&nbsp; A month of that
prospect!&nbsp; And not only that, but something worse; for, upon
the wings of the slow night wind, there drifted over to me the
mournful thrumming of a guitar.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>As it has turned out, the caravanners have proved very little
trouble to any, and to myself least of all.&nbsp; In a day or
two, they moved down to the riverside, choosing one of the
wildest and leafiest corners of the old abandoned chalk-quarry;
and for a week past I have seen nothing of them but a wisp of
blue smoke from afar.</p>
<p>And, indeed, October in the country, if your design is to keep
step and step with the month through all its bewildering changes,
leaves you but scanty leisure for social traffic with your
kind.&nbsp; Every day now there is something new to wonder at,
and ponder over.</p>
<p>To-day the gossamer was flying.&nbsp; If you stood in one of
the low-lying sheltered meadows, and turned your back to the
light, the air seemed full <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>of these ashen-grey flecks, some
only the merest threads, others of the breadth of a finger and
several inches long.&nbsp; I have always believed that the
gossamer spiders sit in the hedgerows spinning these fairy
draperies, and letting them go upon the breeze to little more use
and purpose than when a child blows soap-bubbles for the mere
delight of watching them soar.&nbsp; At least, what end could
possibly be served by them, other than the sufficient and obvious
one of bringing a note of austere, chilly delicacy into the
riotous colour of an October day?&nbsp; But idling along this
morning with literally thousands of these grey filaments
tempering the rich gold of the sunshine far and near, I chanced
to stretch forth a hand and capture one of them.&nbsp; Between my
fingers there hung a shred of fabric infinitely finer than
anything that ever came from loom devised by man; and within it
sat the gossamer spider herself, a shining black atom, evidently
vastly surprised and alarmed at the sudden termination of her
flight.&nbsp; After that I pulled down a score or so of these
gossamer air-ships, and although a few were tenantless, the most
of them bore a passenger embarked on, who shall say how long and
how hazardous a voyage?&nbsp; Yet, while none fell to earth as I
watched, but seemed to have the power of rising ever higher and
higher, it is certain that the gossamer <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>spider&rsquo;s flight must end with each day&rsquo;s
sun.&nbsp; The heavy autumn dews must sweep the air clear of them
at first tinge of dusk.</p>
<p>If there is anything in the old saying that a plentiful berry
harvest foretells a hard winter, then have we bitter times in
store.&nbsp; The hedges are loaded with scarlet wherever you go,
and yet in all this flaunting brilliance there seems to be no two
shades of red alike The holly-berries approach more nearly than
any to pure vermilion.&nbsp; Then come the hips, the
rose-berries, with their tawny red; and the haws that are richer
of hue than all others, perhaps, yet of a sombreness that
quietens the eye for all its glow.&nbsp; Ruddy are the bryonies
and the bittersweet.&nbsp; The rowans love to hold aloft their
masses of pure flame, the rich rowan-colour that is always seen
against the sky.&nbsp; Along the edge of the hazel copse, where
the butcher&rsquo;s broom grows, its curious oblong fruit gives
another note of red.&nbsp; But they are all essentially different
colours.&nbsp; Nature often duplicates herself in blues, yellows,
and particularly in a certain shade of pale purple, of which the
mallow is a common type.&nbsp; But among red flowers, red
berries, finding one, you shall not find its exact counterpart in
hue in all the country-side.</p>
<p>In southern England, the general lurid effect due to change of
leafage in the forest trees <a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>belongs of right to November, but
already there are abundant signs of what is coming.&nbsp; Though
the woods, on a distant view, still look gloriously green, a
nearer prospect reveals a touch of autumn in almost every
tree.&nbsp; In the beech-woods nearly all the branches are tipped
with brown.&nbsp; The elms have bright yellow patches oddly
dispersed amidst foliage still of almost summer-like
freshness.&nbsp; The willows by the river are full of golden
pencillings.&nbsp; Only the oaks remain as yet uninfluenced by
the changing times.&nbsp; The temperate autumn nights, that have
checked the sap-flow of less hardy things, have had no influence
on the oak-woods.&nbsp; They wait for the first real
frosts&mdash;the knock-down blow.</p>
<p>And strangely, though October is nearing its end, the frosts
do not come.&nbsp; The nights are still, moist, dark; and full of
the twanging note of dorbeetles, and now and again the steady
whir of passing wings.&nbsp; This is the sound made by the hosts
of migrant birds, all journeying southward, travelling in silence
and by stealth of night.</p>
<p>Coming out into the darkness, and hearing this mighty rushing
note high overhead, you get a queer sense of underhand activity
and concealed purpose in the world, as though scenery were being
swiftly changed, a new piece hurriedly staged, under cover of the
blinked lights.&nbsp; It tends towards a feeling that is rather
foreign, not <a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>to say humbling, to your desires&mdash;that of being
made a spectator rather than a participant in the great earth
play.&nbsp; Or it may have another and a stranger effect.&nbsp;
The sound of all that strenuous motion, the deep travel-note high
in the darkness, may come to you with all the urging inspiration
of a summons: you may restrain only with difficulty, and much
assembling of prudence, the impulse to gird up and be off
southward in the track of the flying host.&nbsp; The old nomadic
instinct is not dead in humanity, as he well knows who keeps his
feet to the green places of earth, and his heart tiding with the
sun.</p>
<p>Now, too, the brown owl begins his hollow plaint in the
woodlands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Woo-hoo-hoo, woohoo!&rsquo; comes to you
through the fast-falling dusk, the direction and intensity of the
cry varying with astonishing swiftness, as you stop to listen on
your homeward way.&nbsp; This is conceivably the
&lsquo;to-whoo&rsquo; that Shakespeare heard; and there is
another note, which seems to be an answer to it, and which sounds
something like &lsquo;Ker-wick,&rsquo; and might by a stretch be
allowed to stand for the &lsquo;to-whit&rsquo; in the song.&nbsp;
But &lsquo;to-whit, to-whoo!&rsquo; in a single phrase, from a
single throat&mdash;that seems to be a piece of owl language that
has become obsolete with the centuries.</p>
<p><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>There
is a stretch of lane here, running between high grassy banks
densely overshadowed by trees, which is always dark on the
clearest nights of any season, but of a Cimmerian blackness on
these moonless evenings in late October.&nbsp; As if they knew
their opportunity for service, the glowworms often light up the
place from end to end, so that it is possible, steering by their
tiny lamps alone, to keep out of the ditch that yawns invisibly
on either hand.&nbsp; I came through the lane this evening, and
counted near upon a score of these vague blotches of greenish
radiance hovering amidst the dew soaked grass, each bright enough
to show the time by a watch held near.&nbsp; As long as I can
remember, glowworms have been plentiful in this stretch of dark,
overshadowed lane, and very scarce in all other quarters of the
village.&nbsp; New colonies of glowworms seem difficult to
establish, although single lights do appear in places where they
have not been seen before, and in ensuing year appear again and
again, generally in slowly increasing numbers.&nbsp; It is not
wonderful that glowworms should keep to the same grassy bank
season after season, because, as all countrymen know, it is only
the lampless male that flies.&nbsp; The female, who bears the
light, and on whom the persistence of the race depends, lives and
dies probably within no more than the same few square yards <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>of tangled
herbage.&nbsp; What seems really wonderful is that single
glowworms of the female sex should occur in places far removed
from old resorts of their kind, seeing how feeble are their
means, and how slow their rate of travel.</p>
<p>I have said that the flocks of birds that can sometimes be
heard in the quiet of October nights, passing seaward over the
village, are generally silent, save for the dull, pulsating roar
of their wings.&nbsp; As I lifted the latch of the garden-gate
to-night, and stood a moment listening in the darkness, the old
sound grew out of the silence of the hills, and there went
swiftly by what seemed only a small flock; but now and again, as
they passed, I could hear a note bandied to and fro in the
company, a chuckling, voluble note, which I recognised
instantly.&nbsp; They were fieldfares, the first-comers of their
species.&nbsp; From now onward, I knew, their queer outlandish
cry would mingle with the common sounds of the fields; and not
only theirs, but the notes of all other foreign birds that winter
here; for the field-fare is generally the last to come.</p>
<p>This cry in the darkness above me, however, was strange in a
double sense; because, while the silent hosts were emigrants,
only at the commencement of their long, perilous journey, this
chattering company had safely arrived at its bourne, all the
hazards of the voyage happily <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>past.&nbsp; And it seemed only in
the way of Nature, for bird or man, to set forth mute of voice
upon a difficult and dangerous enterprise; while to win through
safe and sound must provoke each alike to
self-congratulation.&nbsp; My fieldfares were halloaing because
they were out of the wood.</p>

<p>The first frosts had come and gone, and left us in the midst
of the usual revolutions and surprises.&nbsp; In a single day,
the ash-trees had cast their whole weight of foliage to earth,
green as in summer prime.&nbsp; Though as yet not a single leaf
had fallen from the other forest trees, all had changed
miraculously.&nbsp; The beech-woods looked like vast smouldering
fires.&nbsp; Every elm stood up clothed to its finger-tips in
shreds of gold-leaf.&nbsp; Here and there in the wood a dash of
vivid scarlet showed where a sycamore had been found and struck
by the frost.&nbsp; Larch, willow, maple, birch, each added to
the glowing <a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>prospect its individual shade of tawny brown, or drab,
or yellow.&nbsp; We walked in a land where, for once, the
sunshine seemed a superfluous thing.&nbsp; To turn the eye away
for a little while from all that intolerable radiance, and rest
it on the oak-woods where alone a vestige of summer greenery
endured, or on the cool grey stems of the stripped ash-trees, was
a pleasure I found myself furtively snatching as we went along,
although I left the sentiment discreetly unexpressed.&nbsp; The
old vicar stopped, removed his great white panama, and mopped his
forehead luxuriously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No warmth, no shine!&rsquo; he repeated.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now where in the world could the poor soul have lived who
wrote that?&nbsp; And no bees!&nbsp; Why, I can hear them
now&mdash;thousands of them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was true enough, and with the bees were the November
butterflies too, if he could only have seen them.&nbsp; In a
sunny corner by the path-side stood an old pollard ash, its trunk
rearing up out of the thicket high over our heads, like a huge
doubled fist thrust into a green gauntlet of ivy.&nbsp; It was
only one tree among innumerable others in the wood, and the same
stirring scene was enacting round each of them.&nbsp; Though with
everything else the season was autumn, for the ivy it was the
heyday of spring.&nbsp; The great tree above us was smothered in
golden blossom, the nectar glistening in the sunshine, a rich
honey <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>scent burdening the still air.&nbsp; There were not
only hive-bees and butterflies rioting at this, the last outdoor
feast of the year, but bumble-bees, wasps, drone-flies, every
other creature that could fly and had escaped the chills of the
November nights.&nbsp; The air was misty with the glint of their
wings, and full of a deep sweet song.&nbsp; As we passed along by
the wood, we were always either drawing into the zone of this ivy
music or leaving it behind us, and never once did it forsake our
path all the morning through.</p>
<p>We came at last to a spot where the woods fell back from the
waterside, and a stretch of wild, hillocky grassland, overgrown
with brier and bramble, bordered the stream.&nbsp; Between the
willows that stood upon the bank dipping their yellow autumn
tresses in the flood, I could see the placid breadth of the
river, with its topsy-turvy vision of the glowing hills
beyond&mdash;hills that, by reason of the interlacing boughs
above, were directly invisible.&nbsp; A lark broke up almost from
under our feet, and went slanting aloft into the blue sky,
singing as though it were April.&nbsp; The Reverend put a hand
upon my arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well: what do you see?&rsquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Everything must be changed since we were here last,
and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said I, rather disturbed, &lsquo;a
painter&rsquo;s easel straddled in front of your favourite
creek&mdash;an easel with a three-legged stool before it, but no
painter.&nbsp; I see also, a little farther on, a big white
umbrella, with the top of a sombrero just showing above it, and a
great cloud of tobacco smoke drifting out of it, but here again
no other sign of painter or man.&nbsp; Shall we go
back?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he was for pushing on.&nbsp; As we approached the
umbrella, a throaty tenor voice was uplifted to a weird foreign
strain:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;En passant par Square Montholon,<br />
La digue-digue donc! la digue-digue donc!<br />
Je rencontre une jeune tendron!<br />
La digue-digue&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Superb!&nbsp; <i>Su</i>-perb!&nbsp; If only I could
excite myself to&mdash;&nbsp; Ah! if only that tumultuous thrill,
which I know always presages&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;la
digue-digue donc!<br />
J&rsquo;offre tout de suite ma main&mdash;ye<br />
La brigue-donc-dain-ye&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or at least so the gibberish sounded.&nbsp; But now it
suddenly left off.&nbsp; A palette went rattling to the
ground.&nbsp; The short squat figure of the owner of the caravan
burst into view.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Grewes! I cannot do it, I really cannot!&nbsp; I <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>am not
sufficiently inspired to-day!&nbsp; I am not great enough!&nbsp;
I&mdash;&nbsp; Oh! I beg your pardon!&nbsp; I thought it was my
friend&rsquo;s step.&nbsp; Why! the water-bearer, to be
sure!&nbsp; How do you do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was my first glimpse of Spelthorne by light of day, and I
owned to myself frankly that the night had been kind to
him.&nbsp; A fringe of yellow-grey hair escaped in all directions
beyond the brim of his hat.&nbsp; He had a florid, puffy,
indeterminate face, eyes at once selfish and sentimental, and a
week-old beard still further ostracised a chin already too
retiring.&nbsp; Like his companion, he wore a gold watch-chain of
heavy calibre, with a bunch of seals and trinkets upon it; but
his clothes, that in the darkness had seemed much tattered and
torn, now appeared entirely disreputable.&nbsp; They were,
moreover, covered with finger-marks of paint, to which he was now
adding, as he ceremoniously welcomed us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Art&mdash;what is it?&rsquo; he cried, removing his
hat, and running his fingers through his hair, when presently, at
his earnest invitation, the Reverend had sat himself down before
the easel, and was making a grave show of inspecting the canvas
on it.&nbsp; &lsquo;And the artist&mdash;where is
he?&rsquo;&nbsp; He made a dramatic pause.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where indeed?&rsquo; quoth the Reverend, grimly staring
before him.</p>
<p><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>&lsquo;You see this picture?&rsquo;&mdash;wagging a
chrome-yellow thumb over the canvas&mdash;&lsquo;nine-tenths of
it are the work of one exalted day: the rest the unilluminated
toil of a week!&nbsp; Strange that we should be made so!&nbsp; At
one moment, like Prometheus, stealing the very fire from heaven,
and at the next&mdash;&nbsp; Ah! but only an artist can really
comprehend!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He filled his pipe, with a resigned, quiet sadness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now Grewes&mdash;that is my friend who is travelling
with me&mdash;&rsquo; he went on; &lsquo;Grewes, poor fellow, he
never realises the difficulties in his path
because&mdash;because&mdash;&nbsp; Let me put it in the kindest
way.&nbsp; Because&mdash;well, the truth is, poor Grewes has
mistaken his calling.&nbsp; No better fellow in the world, you
know!&nbsp; A hard plodder: always trying, always doing his best;
but&mdash;but&mdash;&nbsp; You see, that brings us back to what I
said just now: art and the artist&mdash;where will you find them?
and what are they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A slight cough sounded in our rear.&nbsp; Looking round, I saw
that the long lean man had returned to his easel unmarked by any
of us.&nbsp; The Reverend got abruptly to his feet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you have a great
responsibility.&nbsp; Supreme gifts in a man mean that much will
be required of him.&nbsp; So bend your back to it.&nbsp; Good
day!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>As we
passed by the other easel, its owner looked up pleasantly, but
his brush kept busily to work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go yet,&rsquo; he entreated, &lsquo;I am so
glad to&mdash;&nbsp; But you won&rsquo;t mind, will you, if I go
on with&mdash;&nbsp; You see, I have not had very long at it this
morning.&nbsp; Spelthorne, he was getting so anxious about the
stew, that I&mdash;I had to run back to the caravan
and&mdash;&nbsp; Or else he would have&mdash;&nbsp; It
wouldn&rsquo;t have done, of course, to let him go himself.&nbsp;
When once he has got into the mood, the slightest little
thing&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He rambled on thus, scarcely ever finishing a sentence, and
all the while dabbing away industriously at his sketch.&nbsp; He,
too, I had never yet beheld in daylight; but, unlike his friend,
sunshine rather improved his appearance than otherwise.&nbsp; It
could not fill up the gaps in his coat, nor had it a lustrating
effect upon his linen; yet it revealed in his long, cadaverous
face, and in his mild, sad eyes, a delicacy, a sensibility, that
I had not remarked in them before.&nbsp; As he talked, the old
vicar studied his voice attentively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Spelthorne,&rsquo; he went on, in his curious,
disjointed, breathless way, &lsquo;Spelthorne, his work is so
immeasurably&mdash;&nbsp; He has such a demand for it
that&mdash;&nbsp; And I am always so glad, of course, to do any
little thing to save him trouble.&nbsp; <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>I&mdash;I
really think no man in the world ever had a better
friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Reverend was standing close behind him now.&nbsp; He laid
a hand gently on Grewes&rsquo;s dilapidated shoulder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;at least
don&rsquo;t hurry with your mind.&nbsp; Above all, don&rsquo;t
worry: it is all coming beautifully.&nbsp; When did you see your
doctor last?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The question, unexpected as it was by myself, seemed to
surprise Grewes infinitely more.&nbsp; The blood got up into two
bright points in his cheeks.&nbsp; His brushes rattled against
his palette.&nbsp; He looked round at the old vicar
tremulously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doctor?&nbsp; Why, do you&mdash;&nbsp; What makes you
think I&mdash;&nbsp; Oh! I am very well indeed; never
better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, looking up into the sightless, kindly blue eyes
that appeared to be as steadily gazing down into his.&nbsp; There
was a moment&rsquo;s silence.&nbsp; And then, if I ever saw real
untrammelled joy spring into a human face, I saw it in his.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you really think so?&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You think I&mdash;&nbsp; Well, sometimes lately I have
thought myself that&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Spelthorne&rsquo;s voice grumbled out from behind the
umbrella.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, my dear Grewes, have I not frequently <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>told you
that, though I am willing to lend you anything I have, I always
expect&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Grewes sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is his cadmium,&rsquo; he whispered,
horrified.&nbsp; &lsquo;I borrowed it, and never&mdash;&nbsp; How
very annoying for him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now there is a strange thing,&rsquo; said the Reverend
musingly, as we trudged on our way together.&nbsp; &lsquo;A man
well on in a rapid decline, and neither knowing nor caring about
it; as glad, indeed, to hear the thing confirmed as if some one
had left him a legacy!&nbsp; A month, did you say?&nbsp; Then he
may never go out of Windlecombe by the road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We made a long day&rsquo;s round, taking meadow, riverside,
wood, and downland in our walk, and reaching home again only when
the lights were beginning to star the misty combe; for we had a
special object in our journey.&nbsp; To the townsman it may well
seem as fruitless a task to seek wild flowers in November, as to
go &lsquo;gathering nuts in May.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, here is a
list of what we found in one November day&rsquo;s ramble about a
single village in highland Sussex&mdash;fifty-seven distinct
species, and of many we could have gathered, not single flowers,
but whole handfuls, had we willed.&nbsp; Nor is the list an
exhaustive one either for the district or the time of year.&nbsp;
Bringing more eyesight, leisure, and diligence to <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>the task,
no doubt a fuller inventory could be made in any mild
season.&mdash;</p>

<h3>II</h3>
<p>There has come a spell of chilly, overcast weather, and the
long dark evenings have settled upon us at a stroke.&nbsp; At
twilight to-day, as I came into this silent-floored, comfortable
room, and lit the candles on my work-table, it seemed strange
that I should do so, and yet the ordinary life and traffic of the
village be still going on <a name="page267"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>outside.&nbsp; Hitherto, so it
appeared, the village quiet had fallen always before the need for
candlelight.&nbsp; I had looked out before drawing the curtains
close, and heard not a step stirring, seen the windows dark in
the lower storeys of the cottages, and here and there a pale
light glimmering behind the drawn blinds of upper rooms, for your
true Sussex villager hates to sleep in the dark.&nbsp; But
to-night some new order of things seemed to have been suddenly
ordained.&nbsp; Footsteps hurried or leisurely, voices old and
young, the rumble of wheels, even the distant chime of Tom
Clemmer&rsquo;s hammer&mdash;all the sounds that go to make up
the common rumour of work-a-day life in a village, were abroad in
the air; though already the hills were lost in the gloaming: the
white chrysanthemums by the garden-gate were nothing but a dim
blotch on the murky autumn night.</p>
<p>I lit the candles&mdash;home-made candles of yellow
beeswax&mdash;and set them on their little mats of plaited green
leather.&nbsp; I got out a new quire of foolscap, sobering in its
empty whiteness, its word-hungry look.&nbsp; I arranged the
ruler, the old cut-glass inkpot, the painted leaden frog that
serves for paperweight, the elephant that carries a penwiper as
houdah, ash-tray and tobacco-jar and sheaf of favourite pipes,
all in their proper stations.&nbsp; I drew the old oak
elbow-chair <a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>sideways to the table&mdash;sideways because that was
non-committal: too squarely business-like an approach in the
outset, as I know of old time and cost, often scatters the
fairies into the next county, and you may chew to shreds a whole
quiverful of goose-quills before they again come crowding and
whispering curiously about your ears.</p>
<p>But having made all these exact preparations, I chanced to
turn to the open window for a final look down the street, and
knew at once that I was lost.&nbsp; It was the steady far-off
song from Tom Clemmer&rsquo;s anvil that overcame me more than
anything, and the red glow amidst the elder-boughs that overhung
the forge.&nbsp; But all else conspired in one basilisk-like lure
to get me forth.&nbsp; The busy wending to and fro, and the
cheery commerce of tongues in the darkness, footsteps and voices
that I knew as well as I knew my own; twinkling lights in
cottages, the illumined windows of the little sweetstuff shop,
the cobbler&rsquo;s den, the inn, the village store; the church
lit up for evensong, and the bell quietly tolling, as it seemed,
somewhere far up in the black void of the sky; again, the smell
of the night, that moist, earthy fragrance of decaying leaves,
and tang of frost, and pungent scent of simmering fire-logs from
stacks new-broached on these first chilly evenings in
November&mdash;it <a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>all ranged itself together before me as something, ever
present and constant in my life, that I too often disregarded,
took for granted&mdash;the jumble of thatch and red-tiled roof
and grey flint wall, sheep and lowing kine and cackling poultry,
bevy of kindly human hearts, sharp tongues and willing hands, all
wedged up together in one green crevice of the hills, and calling
themselves collectively by the old South-Saxon name of
Windlecombe.</p>
<p>I went first of all a few strides out over the green and
looked backward, rightly to estimate, if I could, my own part in
the little communal symphony.&nbsp; The bluff bulk of the house,
with its coven roof and many gables, stood dark against the
greyer darkness of the hills, and behind it rose sable elm plumes
fast thinning under the recent autumn chills.&nbsp; From its
windows shone lights of varying significance.&nbsp; There were my
own red-shaded candles with a corner of a crammed bookcase dimly
visible above them; there were naked kitchen lights with ware of
polished pewter and copper glinting behind, and a pleasant
clatter of crockery; there was a window where the light burnt red
and low and wavering as from a spent hearth, and a quiet ripple
of music from a piano keeping it congenial company; there was the
window high up in the great gable, whose flickering light cast a
bunch <a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>of
head-shadows on the ceiling, suggestive of nursery bedtime, and
fairy-tales round the fire.&nbsp; It was all very reassuring and
enheartening.&nbsp; Yes: the old White House had its integral
part to play in this good English game of Neighbourhood, and
played it passing well.</p>
<p>Round Tom Clemmer&rsquo;s forge a group of village lads was
gathered, all looking on at the work with an interest that
amounted well-nigh to fascination.&nbsp; As I came up, and stood
unobserved in the shadow of the elder-tree, there was before me a
picture in which two colours only were represented glowing
crimson and deep velvety black.&nbsp; Young Tom stood, pincers in
hand, watching the iron in the fire.&nbsp; Behind him his
apprentice laboured at the bellows.&nbsp; With every wheezy puff,
the furnace roared out an imprecation, and spat hot cinders upon
the floor.</p>
<p>It was a large piece of metal that Tom had in work, something
out of the ordinary run of his business, it seemed, and he turned
it and shifted it with an anxious eye.&nbsp; No one spoke a word,
for somehow we all knew that a crisis was coming, and we were
expected to hold our tongues until it was victoriously
past.&nbsp; At length the moment came.&nbsp; Tom thrust the
pincers into the blaze and drew the white-hot iron out upon the
anvil.&nbsp; Immediately the apprentice left the bellows, <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>seized a
great hammer, and swinging it over his head, began to let fall on
the metal an unceasing rain of mighty blows.&nbsp; As Tom twisted
and manoeuvred the glowing mass about with all the strength of
his wiry arms, it lengthened, squared itself in the middle,
flattened out at each end, bent into complicated curves, then
turned upon itself and was united miraculously head to
tail.&nbsp; Still gripping the writhing thing with one hand, Tom
took a punch in the other, and pointed it to various parts of the
work; and wherever he pointed, the hammer drove a bolt-hole clean
and true through the rose-red iron.&nbsp; Finally Tom lifted the
finished piece above his head, and came striding to the door with
it.&nbsp; The crowd of onlookers scattered right and left.&nbsp;
Out into the darkness he plunged, and straight to the pool by the
roadside.&nbsp; We saw the thing poised for a moment like a
mammoth fire-fly over the water; and then, with a roar and an
angry splutter, it vanished into the pond.</p>
<p>It was scarcely six o&rsquo;clock, and already the night was
pitch-black, with a creeping, chilly air from the north.&nbsp; It
was not loitering weather.&nbsp; People were moving briskly on
their several ways.&nbsp; Cottage doors were shut, and windows
diamonded with moisture.&nbsp; Roving about with no settled
purpose but to humour the neighbourly fancy, and to identify
myself with the evening life of <a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>the place, I presently came full
tilt at a corner upon Farmer Coles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The very man!&rsquo; said he, barring the way jovially
with his stout oak stick.&nbsp; &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t ye promise me
that when I killed that four-year-old wether, ye&rsquo;d come and
take a bite along o&rsquo; us?&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;tis a saddle
to-night, and I was on the road to fetch ye.&nbsp; Round about,
man, and straight for the faarm!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, when a South-Down flock-master&mdash;whose pedigree sheep
are famous throughout the county&mdash;bids you to his table,
with the announcement that the principal dish is to be mutton,
there is only one thing to do, that is, if you are human, and of
sane mind. I turned and went along with him without demur.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jane&rsquo;s sister and her man be with us,&rsquo; said
Farmer Coles, as we left the village behind and mounted the steep
lane that led to the farmhouse.&nbsp; &lsquo;And Weaverly
&rsquo;ull be there; and the gells be home, so we wunt lack for
company.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know as ye ever met Jane&rsquo;s
sister&rsquo;s man?&mdash;Parrett by name.&nbsp; No?&nbsp;
Wunnerful well-eddicated man, though, he be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We found the Rev. Mr. Weaverly, a shining gem of purest water,
set in the ring of hearty country faces that surrounded the
drawing-room fire.&nbsp; The broad-shouldered, broad-faced man,
with a mat of sandy beard and a very bald head, <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>who
occupied the great armchair in the corner, I judged to be Mr.
Parrett.&nbsp; Mrs. Coles and her sister, both comfortable of
mien and rigidly ceremonious of visage, sat side by side in
flowing black silk gowns, knitting as for a wager.&nbsp; The
younger members of the household, who filled the interspaces of
the circle, fidgeted in a constraint of merry silence, exchanging
covert glances of boredom, and all obviously pricking ears for
the first sound of the dinner-gong.&nbsp; This clanged out behind
us almost at the moment of our entry into the room,
providentially cutting short the first amenities of greeting; and
before my fingers had done aching from Mr. Parrett&rsquo;s grip,
I found myself sitting at the loaded board with Mrs.
Parrett&rsquo;s voluminous drapery overflowing me on the one
side, and, on the other, her husband&rsquo;s great brown
barricade of an elbow securely fencing me in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mutton,&rsquo; observed Mr. Weaverly presently, by way
of filling up a pause in the conversation due to our all watching
with secret anxiety Farmer Coles&rsquo;s attack on the joint,
&lsquo;mutton, and on a Monday!&nbsp; You remember the little
game of alliteration we played at the school treat, Mrs.
Coles?&nbsp; Really, we could make an admirable sequence
here!&nbsp; Mutton, and Monday, and Miss Matilda sitting by my
side, and&mdash;and&mdash;if it were only March instead
of&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>&lsquo;And we&rsquo;ll soon all be munchin&rsquo; of
it, sir!&rsquo; cried Farmer Coles.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ha, ha,
ha!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the best Hem o&rsquo; all!&nbsp; Gravy,
George?&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the inclusion of her name in the sequence, the eldest Miss
Coles had blushed, then let her glance demurely droop upon her
chrysanthemum-wreathed bosom.&nbsp; It was a moment of exceeding
pride and satisfaction to her, for here was Mr. Weaverly beside
her&mdash;an incontestable, a beautiful fact&mdash;while Miss
Sweet for once was half a mile away.&nbsp; Now she looked up
coyly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; she hesitated, &lsquo;I could suggest
a&mdash;&nbsp; Oh! I know a lovely one!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Weaverly laid down knife and fork, to rub his hands
delightedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do tell us!&rsquo; he murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
positively longing to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The eldest Miss Coles turned him glamorous eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marmaduke!&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>And I think I was the only one present to realise the whole
ingenuity of the man&oelig;uvre.&nbsp; For she had contrived
here, in the open family circle, before a dozen people, yet with
entire meetness and propriety, to address Mr. Weaverly by his
Christian name.</p>
<p>As the meal progressed, and tongues became generally loosened,
Mr. Parrett&mdash;whose silence, except as regarded his hearty
application to his <a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>food, had so far remained unbroken&mdash;now essayed to
contribute his share of the talk.&nbsp; His first effort was a
startling one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;D-d-d&rsquo; he began, smiling over his shoulder at me,
&lsquo;d-do you l-l-l&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; He stopped, and gazed
helplessly towards his wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like, dear?&rsquo; suggested Mrs. Parrett, softly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;N-no!&nbsp; I was agoing t-t-to ask ye if ye
l-l-l&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lend, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hur, hur!&nbsp; Emma, I don&rsquo;t want to b-b-borrow
nauthin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the gentleman!&nbsp; It was just to ask
if he l-l-lived&mdash;there y&rsquo; are!&mdash;in
W-w-w&mdash;&nbsp; Whatsay, Jane?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis apple-pie, George.&nbsp; Or maybe ye&rsquo;d
sooner try the&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pie, Jane!&nbsp; Pie, my d-dear!&nbsp; Pie, if
<i>you</i> please, mum!&nbsp; An&rsquo; a double dose o&rsquo;
sh-sh-shuggar.&nbsp; They allers says&mdash;don&rsquo;t they,
sir?&mdash;as if a man has a sweet-t-t-t&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sweetheart, dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oo, ay!&rsquo; laughed Mr. Parrett, suddenly
inspired.&nbsp; He looked across the table roguishly at Mr.
Weaverly and Matilda, and all glances followed his.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah, well: n-n-never mind!&nbsp; We was all young once,
and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Coles deftly drew the fire of attention away from the
absorbed, unconscious pair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;William, dear; Emma has nothing in her glass.&nbsp; <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>And there
you sit, staring at the cheese as if&mdash;as if it were only for
show, and as wooden as you are!&nbsp; And do pray pass the old
ale to Mr.&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, deplorably, deplorably so!&rsquo; sighed Mr.
Weaverly to the rapt Matilda.&nbsp; &lsquo;Over and over again I
have remonstrated with her, but all in vain, I fear.&nbsp; Each
time I have said, &ldquo;Mrs. Gates, if you will feed little
children on new hot bread, and red herrings,
and&rdquo;&mdash;only think of it!&mdash;&ldquo;beer, you will
find not only their physical but their moral nature
entirely&mdash;&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is strange how, in a room full of heterogeneous talk, the
attention of a quiet listener flits uncontrollably from one
quarter to another.&nbsp; Much as I was interested in Mrs.
Gates&rsquo;s domestic policy, I lost it here, to find myself in
the rick-yard, taking part, against my will, in some complicated
sporting affray.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And there were three of them, father, in the trough;
and I crept up and got the gun-barrel through a hole in the side
of the sty, and just as the old buck-rat&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then it was Mr. Parrett again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emma &rsquo;ull tell ye b-b-better &rsquo;n me,
Jane.&nbsp; It came hoot-tooting round the corner, and afore I
could s-s-s&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop, George?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;N-n-nonsense!&mdash;afore I could
s-s-s&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seize hold o&rsquo; the&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>&lsquo;Emma, do bide quiet!&mdash;afore I could s-s-say
Jack Robinson, the ould mare, she b-b-backed upon her harnches,
and she&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And from Miss Matilda:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! I should so love to, Mr. Weaverly!&nbsp; Is there a
very beautiful view?&nbsp; And could we walk there and back in an
afternoon, do you think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And from Farmer Coles, folding up his napkin: &lsquo;Well, if
no one wunt have no more&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The rest was lost in the rustle of Mrs. Coles&rsquo;s skirts,
as she uprose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, William dear, I think we ladies will leave you
to your smoke.&nbsp; And when you are quite ready, we will have a
rubber and a little music.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the drawing-room presently, the farmer and his wife, and
Mr. and Mrs. Parrett, sat down to a solemn, silent game of
whist.&nbsp; A &lsquo;Happy Family&rsquo; party made a vortex of
merriment in a far corner.&nbsp; At the piano stood Mr. Weaverly,
translating into soft melodious trifles such songs as &lsquo;The
Wolf&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hearts of Oak.&rsquo;&nbsp; As for me, I
was happy in the great chair with the family portrait album, full
of early Victorian photographs, which I sincerely believe to be
amongst the most fascinating and informing productions of all
that fertile reign.&nbsp; But after an hour of this inspiring
occupation, I was suddenly roused to <a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>the contemplation of a still greater
wonder.&nbsp; One of the card-players had spoken, and that
sharply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emma!&nbsp; Emma, my dear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I strolled over, and watched the play.&nbsp; Something had
happened to disturb Mr. Parrett, for though his face was turned
from me, I could see that his bald head had taken on a purple
hue.&nbsp; And gradually, as the game progressed, the mystery
became clear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emma, my d-d-<i>dear</i>!&nbsp; Emma!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was Mr. Parrett&rsquo;s voice again, and this time with a
sharper ring of warning and remonstrance.&nbsp; Two or three
times in the next half-hour he spoke thus, and each time now I
was able to detect the cause.&nbsp; Mrs. Parrett was
cheating.&nbsp; Continually her neck craned for a sidelong view
of her opponents&rsquo; cards.&nbsp; She revoked
unblushingly.&nbsp; Once I could have sworn I saw a card-corner
sticking out of a fold in her silken lap.&nbsp; The aces she
seemed to be trying to mark with her thumb-nail.&nbsp; And all
the time, though Mr. Parrett got momentarily redder and more
wrathful, Farmer Coles and his wife sat serenely smiling,
evidently well used to dear Emma and her little harmless,
eccentric ways.</p>

279</span>III</h3>
<p>Here is a winter&rsquo;s day already, and still
November.&nbsp; As I looked forth at sunrise this morning, the
whole village was white with frost.&nbsp; I could hear the ice in
the wheel-ruts crackling under the tread of passers-by.&nbsp; A
single thrush piped forlornly somewhere in the dense thicket of
the churchyard.&nbsp; And as I leaned out into the nipping blast,
a word came up to me, bandied between a trudging labourer and his
friend, a word that brought with it an entire new sheaf of
thoughts and memories.&nbsp; &lsquo;More &rsquo;n &rsquo;aaf like
Christmas, bean&rsquo;t ut, Bill?&rsquo;&nbsp; It was said but in
jest, and that unthinkingly.&nbsp; Yet, by the calendar, as a
glance now told me, Christmas was scarce a month away.</p>
<p>While the sun was yet no more than a white spot in the faint
gold mists of morning, I took the lane that led to the
Downs.&nbsp; It was strange to see how the frost had missed all
the bright-hued berries in the hedgerows, and how the ivy-leaves
were only rimmed with white.&nbsp; It was the same with the
prickly holly foliage.&nbsp; The spines were thickly encrusted,
while the dark green membranes of the leaves had given no
fingerhold to the frost.&nbsp; But the colour of the grass, and
dead dry herbage, by the wayside was completely blotted
out.&nbsp; Every blade and twig stood up <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>stark and
white against its fellow; and here it was easy to see which way
the frozen air had been drifting all night long, because on the
windward side the pale accretion was thicker: in the more exposed
places it more than doubled the natural girth of the stems.</p>
<p>Where the dew-pond lay, at the top of the hill, far above the
swimming lowland mists, there must have been bright sunshine from
the very first; for here the veneer of frost had melted into
dewdrops, that flashed back a thousand prismatic rays amidst the
emerald of the grass at every step.&nbsp; But behind each
upstanding tussock, the frost still held as white and thick as
ever.&nbsp; The water, too, in the pond was still frozen
over.&nbsp; As I came up to the rail, a flock of starlings rose
whirring over my head.&nbsp; They had been waiting there on the
sunny side of the bank for the ice to melt round the pond edges,
and thither they would return to slake their morning thirst, as
soon as I passed on.</p>
<p>Keen and unkindly blew the blast, so that one must keep ever
moving to withstand the chill of it.&nbsp; Looking round me on
the waste of hills, I could see that the northern slopes still
retained their wintry hue, though all those facing to the sun
were intensely green.&nbsp; Below in the valley only the
oak-woods kept their bronze stain of autumn.&nbsp; Every other
tree, the hedges that <a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>divided ploughlands and meadows, the
winding line of thicket marking the course of the river, all
looked bare and dark in the glistening pallor of the sun.&nbsp;
The river itself, between the broad water-meadows, seemed like a
river of ink.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

"&ldquo;The Ferryman&rsquo;s Cottage&rdquo;"

</a></p>
<p>As I took in all the cheerless, void purity of what lay below
me, thinking to myself that this indeed was winter, there came a
sudden cawing and dawing high up in the frosty steel-blue dome of
the sky; and here again was confirmation of that unenlivening
fact.&nbsp; A great company of rooks and jackdaws was streaming
by, but with none of its summer zest and purpose.&nbsp; The
throng made a general progress towards the south, yet it was
obviously doing little more than killing time, spinning out the
business of a doubtful journey into the semblance of a
morning&rsquo;s task.&nbsp; Instead of going straight forward in
one steady strong tide, the birds were incessantly veering back
in wide circles, crossing and re-crossing each other&rsquo;s
paths aimlessly, and weaving a mazy dark pattern on the sky.</p>
<p>I watched this dubious host from the hill-top until it
vanished in the eye of the sun; and then, fairly beaten at last
by the razor-edged north wind, turned and went back to the
village.&nbsp; It was winter again, in very truth; and there was
little sense or profit in blinking it.&nbsp; I would strike my
flag now, as I had struck it often before.&nbsp; <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>And the
flag with me was the little staging of fernery that still
concealed the yawning blackness of my study hearth.&nbsp; I
pulled it all down and stowed it away; and by and by, when the
ash logs were sizzling and glowing, and the sparks were volleying
up the flue, and a living warmth pervading the room, I plucked up
new heart and courage:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;No mirth, no cheerfulness, no healthful
ease,<br />
No comfortable feel in any member;<br />
No warmth, no shine&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was all as false now as it must ever have been.&nbsp; And
as for butterflies and bees, what but a sick fancy could crave
for such delicacies out of season?</p>
<h2><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>DECEMBER</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> sat on the churchyard wall, the
Reverend and I, debating many things.</p>
<p>It was one of those silent, gloomy afternoons that would be
cold but for their exceeding stillness.&nbsp; A heavy grey pall
of sky lowered overhead.&nbsp; A multitude of noisy sparrows was
going to bed in the thicket of ilex and yew, denoting that the
time was nearing sunset, although not a tinge of sunset colour
showed in the shrouded west.&nbsp; The same impulse, it seemed,
had brought us both out of doors, which, elementally, was nothing
more than a sudden realisation of the impossibility of remaining
within.&nbsp; In the whole year&rsquo;s round, perhaps, there
come only two or three days like this.&nbsp; You become the prey
of a conviction that something cataclysmic is going to
happen.&nbsp; There is a sense of the world slowing down in its
age-long, giddy race through the pathless ether; a feeling that
its momentum is almost spent, and that any instant it may come <a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>to a final
stop, to be followed by the Last Trump and dissolution of all
things.&nbsp; The mute house seems alive about you, and full of a
sort of terror and foreboding.&nbsp; You are seized with an
apprehension that the ceilings and roof are falling in; and,
hurrying forth, a like doubt comes upon you as to the stability
of the sky: it looks so overburdened and unsafe.&nbsp; In this
easeless, impotent frame of mind, I came up into the churchyard
as being the most reassuring place I could think of, and found
the Reverend wandering there for a like reason and in much the
same mood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wind and dirty weather coming,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;the sort of times to make people think of home and
fireside, the need for human peace on earth, and good-will
towards men&mdash;the very weather for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As we sat on the wall, silent awhile, the bells in far-off
Stavisham began their chime, every note drifting over to us sharp
and clear through the miles of torpid air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Winter coming,&rsquo; he went on; &lsquo;the winter we
all need once a year to knit us closer together.&nbsp; Listen to
Saint Barnabas practising his Christmas carillons!&mdash;forging
his link in the chain of bell-ringing that in a week or two will
stretch all round the world.&nbsp; It is my time coming, my own
time.&nbsp; For did you ever think how little <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>eyesight
matters at Christmas?&nbsp; Blindness is nothing to a man
then.&nbsp; Christmas is all glad sound; warm heart-beats;
faithful words.&nbsp; And, please God, when the day dawns, there
shall not be a cottage-nest in Windlecombe that does not overflow
with these.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To see him so deeply moved, and hear him run on presently
about his many schemes of comfort and relief, the furtherance of
joy and merriment, good-will and good cheer, to be sown broadcast
throughout his little domain, was yourself to take the infection
irresistibly.&nbsp; Whatever Christmas has become in the great
outer world, in Windlecombe he held us year by year to all the
old ideals and traditions.&nbsp; As I harkened to him, the black
sky, the sullen, miasmic air, lost their significance.&nbsp; I
found myself thinking only of the golden light and undimmed azure
that must eternally lie beyond and above it all.&nbsp; And
now&mdash;though I might have heard it long ago, if I had had but
the heart to look up and listen&mdash;there, high against the
drab heaven, a lark soared and sang.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The dirty weather has come indeed.&nbsp; For many days I have
not seen the tops of the hills.&nbsp; They have been hidden in
the rain-clouds that have <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>been dragging ceaselessly over the
combe.&nbsp; The rain has not seemed to fall, but to flow
horizontally from west to east, a gliding white curtain of
water-drops, hiding all but the nearest houses from the
view.&nbsp; And yet, for all the deluge and the sobbing wind, the
gloom, the cold, the miry ways, I would not change this solitary,
inaccessible spot in England for the best of foreign sunshine,
ease, and gaiety to be found by the Tideless Sea.</p>
<p>Perhaps, if winter is to be given a place at all in the
calendar, it must come in these few weeks leading on to
Christmas.&nbsp; It is true that, so far as the natural outdoor
world is concerned, there is no winter, in the human conception
of a season of decay and death.&nbsp; In an hour, when the sky
lightened a little and the rain ceased its rattle on the window,
I went out and found next year&rsquo;s corn greening the
hill-side; and in all the bare dark woodland there was not a twig
without its new buds ripe and ready for another spring.&nbsp; The
year&rsquo;s miracle-play was beginning all over again before its
last lines were said.</p>
<p>Yet because, as the old vicar maintains, winter is a human
necessity by reason of its heart-welding, neighbour-making
qualities, winter we must all have; and so at this time I am glad
to hoodwink myself into the belief that the rough-voiced,
harrying weather is the very negation of <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>life,
bringing us all together for mutual comfort, like children in the
dark.</p>
<p>The rain is over now, seemingly for good.&nbsp; Last night at
sundown the wind fell, and the grey cloud canopy lifted off to
the northward, like the opening lid of a box.&nbsp; As the dense
cloud pack broke away from the western horizon, the sun burst
through, and poured a sudden stream of red-gold light up the
combe.&nbsp; Before this light had paled, the whole sky was
crystal clear; and in the east, just above the earth-line, shone
the moon&mdash;a perfect human face, full-jowled, low-foreheaded,
gazing down upon us all with a puzzled, quizzical smile upon her
comfortable chops.&nbsp; I came up the street apostrophising her,
and ran into a basket, and behind the basket was Grewes.&nbsp; He
laid a bunch of lean bony fingers in my hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is life again,&rsquo; he said feelingly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;To be weatherbound in a caravan, you know&mdash;&nbsp;
Well, it is a little trying even for common people, but for a
genius&mdash;Spelthorne, you see, cannot bear any
constraint.&nbsp; At home he has a studio as big as a church, and
when it rains he walks up and down it.&nbsp; But when he tries
that in a caravan&mdash;&nbsp; Really, I have been very sorry for
him, though of course I kept outside as much as I
could.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had turned and strolled back with him under <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>the pale
December twilight.&nbsp; The new quiet of things, the frosty
glimmer of the moon, here and there a star beginning to show, the
renovated life of the village about us&mdash;all made for peace
and content.&nbsp; Grewes suddenly stopped and laid his basket
down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Spelthorne wants to move on now,&rsquo; he told me;
&lsquo;he says we have painted the place out, and I haven&rsquo;t
tried to persuade him, you know, but&mdash;but&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t want to go, and that&rsquo;s a fact.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me distressfully, his stubbly lantern jaw in his
lean hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What has happened to change the place so?&rsquo; he
asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Everybody you meet looks as if bound for a
wedding.&nbsp; You are all humming carol tunes wherever you
go.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t seen a dirty-faced child for a
week.&nbsp; And how the people joke and laugh with each
other!&nbsp; It can&rsquo;t be all because
Christmas&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;it is all because one
old man we love insists on having it so, year by year.&nbsp; He
has been into every home in the village, great and small, and
fired each man, woman, and child with his own rejoicing
spirit.&nbsp; If you stop for the next ten days, you will see
things change more thoroughly still.&nbsp; Wait till you see them
bringing the Christmas-tree up the hill for the children&rsquo;s
treat!&nbsp; And the committee going <a name="page289"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>round on Boxing-Day to award the
prizes for the home decorations!&nbsp; And if you have never
heard real old-fashioned carols, nor listened to a real Christmas
sermon preached by a holy angel in a white
beard&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took up his basket hurriedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If&mdash;if I must go,&rsquo; he said, as we trudged on
towards the quarry where the caravan had made its pitch, &lsquo;I
shall think of you all wherever I&mdash;&nbsp; It seems rather
selfish to press him, don&rsquo;t you think?&nbsp; But
perhaps&mdash;&nbsp; Oh! here we are!&nbsp; Do come in and talk
to Spelthorne for a bit, will you?&nbsp; He sees so little
company, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that you at last, Grewes?&nbsp; My good fellow, what
an unconscionable time to take in procuring no more than one
pennyworth of pepper and just a pound of gravy beef!&nbsp; To say
that I am excessively annoyed is wholly to understate
my&mdash;&nbsp; Of course all my carefully-thought-out plans for
the meal are entirely upset!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I drew back into the darkness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not to-night.&nbsp; There are times when you cannot
stand&mdash;I mean, when a call is not convenient,
and&mdash;&nbsp; Why on earth don&rsquo;t you tell the selfish
old brute to go to smithereens?&rsquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>III</h3>
<p>This has been a week of undeniably hard work for us all, and
one, at least, is by no means sorry that to-morrow is Christmas
Eve.</p>
<p>Most of the time I seem to have spent on the top of a rickety
step-ladder in the school-room, having tin-tacks and boughs of
holly and gaily-coloured flags passed up to me by Mr. Weaverly
and the mutually distrustful Miss Sweet and Miss Matilda
Coles.&nbsp; Tom Clemmer, helped by half a dozen others, brought
the great tree up from Windle Woods, and it stands now in its tub
of spangled cotton-wool, a gorgeous sight, every branch weighed
down with toy-shop treasures, the queen-doll at its apex
brandishing her gilt-starred sceptre high up among the oaken
beams of the ceiling.&nbsp; Every available chair or bench in the
village has been confiscated, and ranged round the room.&nbsp;
The tables at the far end fairly creak and groan under their
burden of infantile good cheer.&nbsp; It is all ready for
to-morrow.&nbsp; We put in the finishing touches with the last
gleam of daylight this evening, Weaverly and I alone
together.&nbsp; Then he locked the door, speechlessly tired and
happy, and faded away&mdash;a black but benevolent ghost in
goloshes&mdash;down the length of the darkening street.</p>
<p>As for me, I followed at a respectful distance <a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>with no
object definitely in view but to smoke a quiet pipe after the
day&rsquo;s work, and enjoy the unwonted life and bustle of the
village.</p>
<p>Thinking it over discriminately, it seemed to be a great
thing, a real advance on the true line of social progress, to be
strolling about there, taking unfeigned pleasure in the sight of
two small shops doubtfully illuminated with oil-lamps and
candles, and in the sound made by perhaps fifty people all told,
as they clattered and chattered to and fro in a single, narrow
village street.&nbsp; There were folk, I knew, wandering just as
aimlessly in the crowded thoroughfares of great cities miles
away, whose ears were deafened with a prodigious uproar, and eyes
blinded by a myriad superfluous lights, but who were not half so
entertained, so thoroughly instilled with the sense of being one
in a hustling, happy Christmas multitude, as I.&nbsp; Then again,
of all the thousands that the city promenader meets in the crush
of a London street between one electric standard and the next,
how many can he rightfully greet as neighbour, or even remember
to have seen before?&nbsp; While here was I, after a good
half-hour&rsquo;s loitering up and down, who had encountered none
but old familiar faces, nor let one go by without the kind word
or friendly glance exchanged.&nbsp; Truly the scale, the mere
arithmetic of life goes for nothing: <a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>it is the proportional, the
relative, that counts.&nbsp; There was not so much folly as we
imagine in the grave debate of the old philosophers as to how
many angels could stand upon a pin&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>I tarried awhile in the broad beam of light that fell from the
window of the village store, and, in the company of a dozen other
loiterers, feasted eyes on its Yule-tide splendour.&nbsp; From
where I stood on the opposite side of the way, it seemed no less
than a palace of glittering beauty.&nbsp; Candles of all colours
in little tinselled sconces shone amidst the wares of
everyday&mdash;bacon and worsted stockings, loaves of bread and
tin saucepans, butter, neckties, bars of mottled soap, and
trousers in moleskin or corduroy.&nbsp; The ceiling of the shop,
which at ordinary times is hidden by hanging festoons of boots,
basket-ware, hedging-gloves, coils of rope, was intersected now
by chains of coloured paper and threadled holly-leaves.&nbsp;
There was a suspended roasting-jack in a corner slowly twirling
round a grand set-piece of Christmas knick-knacks; and there were
two copper coalscuttles, the one filled with oranges, the other
heaped high with bunches of green grapes that made the mouth
water a dozen yards away.&nbsp; All these I gazed upon, and at
the jostling throng of housewives, at least half a score, within,
and at the red-faced, perspiring shopkeeper overdone with
business; and <a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>from the bottom of my heart, I rejoiced that they
sufficed for me, that I should go to bed that night with as
complete a sense of having looked on at the great world&rsquo;s
Yuletide gladness as if I had tired out feet and eyes and nerves
in the roaring maelstrom at the Elephant, or the Messina Strait
of the Strand.&nbsp; For indeed life and its disciplines, its
experiences, its outcomes, can be no mere matters of dimension:
when we come at last to find eternity and the angels, they are as
like to be on a pin&rsquo;s point as out-thronging all the
labyrinth of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>From the village store I moved on presently to the little
sweetstuff shop, and stood awhile looking in through the
holly-garlanded door.&nbsp; Susan sat in a wilderness of
scalloped silver paper, presiding over a lucky tub.&nbsp; There
was no getting near her to-night for the mob of children that
surrounded her, and overflowed into the street; but she bawled me
an affectionate Christmas greeting, and passed me, by half a
dozen intervening hands&mdash;in exchange for a thrown
halfpenny&mdash;a packet from the lucky-dip, which proved to
contain a cherubim modelled out of pink scented soap.&nbsp; With
this symbolic testimony to our old-time friendship bulging my
pocket, I went rambling on again, and in course of time arrived
at the Three Thatchers Inn.&nbsp; A tilt-cart was just driving
away from the door.&nbsp; <a name="page294"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 294</span>A numerous company was gathered
outside, speeding the vehicle on its way with laugh and jest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ve not fared so bad,&rsquo; roared old Daniel
Dray, as he spied me in the darkness, &lsquo;though ye
didn&rsquo;t come to th&rsquo; drawin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ve
got a topside, an&rsquo; a hand o&rsquo; pig-meat.&nbsp;
Stall&rsquo;ard here, he&rsquo;s got wan o&rsquo; th&rsquo;
turkeys, an&rsquo; young George Artlett th&rsquo; tother.&nbsp; A
good club it ha&rsquo; been, considerin&rsquo;.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
now the lot o&rsquo; us ha&rsquo; got to bide here &rsquo;til
Dan&rsquo;l gets hoame from Stavisham wi&rsquo; th&rsquo;
tack.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This annual prize-drawing, and division of the Christmas Club
funds, with the subsequent wait in the cosy inn parlour while the
things were fetched from the town, was a great event in
Windlecombe.&nbsp; On this one night in the year, we cultivated
as a fine art the pleasure of anticipation, and each did his best
to make the time go with mirth and neighbourly good-will.&nbsp;
The occasion was also, in some degree, a kind of benefit for the
landlord, to which all might contribute as a duty, if by any
chance the inclination lacked.&nbsp; Looking round the crowded
room, I could think of hardly one of the well-known faces that
was missing.&nbsp; The old ferryman was there&mdash;how he got
there was a mystery; but there he was, in the corner of the
settle whence he had been absent so long.&nbsp; Even George
Artlett had stayed <a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>to await the arrival of his turkey, and now sat at my
side quaffing lemonade, his face as grave and thoughtful as ever,
but his eyes twinkling with a jollity I had never seen in them
before.</p>
<p>Young Daniel knew that no one would desire to curtail this
part of the prize-drawing ceremony, and there was little fear of
his wheels being heard in the sloppy street for a good two hours
to come.&nbsp; We stretched out our legs to the cheery blaze, and
felt that for once we had succeeded in wing-clipping old Father
Time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beef-club drawin&rsquo; agen, Dan&rsquo;l!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay! beef-club drawin&rsquo; agen, Tom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a break in the general clamour, the two veterans exchanged
the thought slowly and pensively, looking down their long
pipe-stems into the fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An&rsquo; no one gone, Dan&rsquo;l.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ne&rsquo;er a wan, Tom, thank God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How quirk &rsquo;a do hould hisself, to be sure,&rsquo;
said old Tom Clemmer after a pause, and none doubted who he
meant.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah! an&rsquo; how &rsquo;a do brisk along
still!&nbsp; Another year o&rsquo; him by&mdash;&rsquo;tis
another blessin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s to un, wi&rsquo; all
our love an&rsquo; dooty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a silent toast, but drunk deep.&nbsp; George
Artlett&rsquo;s glass was lighter than any when he set it
down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t been allers so,&rsquo; old
Clemmer went <a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>on ruminatively.&nbsp; &lsquo;How many drawin&rsquo;s
ha&rsquo; ye seen, Dan&rsquo;l, boy an&rsquo;
man?&mdash;threescore belike, and I bean&rsquo;t fur ahent
ye.&nbsp; An&rsquo; many&rsquo;s th&rsquo; time as summun&rsquo;s
money ha&rsquo; laid on th&rsquo; table wi&rsquo; only widder or
poor-box to claim it; an&rsquo; he, poor soul, quiet i&rsquo;
th&rsquo; litten-yard up there.&nbsp; Ay! &rsquo;tis a lucky
drawin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; nane but livin&rsquo; hands to
draw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Daniel Dray took up the prize-list and scanned it curiously,
his white head thrown back, his spectacles straddling the extreme
tip of his nose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An&rsquo; what,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;will a single
man, onmarried, do wi&rsquo; a whole gurt turkey-burd?&nbsp;
An&rsquo; him wi&rsquo; never a wife!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis wicked
waste, neighbours!&nbsp; Him an&rsquo; th&rsquo; parrot,
they&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; nought but turkey-meat i&rsquo; th&rsquo;
house from now to Lady-time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stallwood&rsquo;s beady black eyes disappeared in a wide
smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knowed a man once,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;out in Utah
State in Murriky, &rsquo;twur&mdash;as got a brace o&rsquo;
ostriches at a Christmas drawin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; when it come to
carvin&rsquo; at dinner-time, th&rsquo; pore feller, he got no
more &rsquo;n half a bite fer hisself because&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp;
He stopped, suddenly recollecting George Artlett&rsquo;s
lustrating presence, &lsquo;Ah! he wur married, I tell ye,
an&rsquo; never a wured o&rsquo; a lie!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;ll &rsquo;a do wi&rsquo; it,
Dan&rsquo;!?&rsquo;&nbsp; The old <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>ferryman leant from his corner
eagerly, staring at the wall as though he saw there the picture
that rose in his mind.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;ll &rsquo;a do
wi&rsquo; it?&nbsp; Jest think on &rsquo;t!&nbsp; Nobbut hisself
in a quiet kitchen o&rsquo; Christmas morning&mdash;his boots on,
an&rsquo; nane to rate un for spannellin&rsquo;
about&mdash;click-clack from the roastin&rsquo; jack, an&rsquo;
tick-tack from th&rsquo; clock, an&rsquo; a good cuss now
an&rsquo; agen from th&rsquo; ould parrot, but never a wured
o&rsquo; wimmin&rsquo;s wrath.&nbsp; Ah, life!&mdash;&rsquo;tis
all jest a gurt beef-club drawin&rsquo;!&nbsp; Some on us draws
peace an&rsquo; quiet an&rsquo; turkey-burds, an&rsquo; some
draws&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>His lips closed on his pipe-stem with a snap.&nbsp; A
commiserate shake of the head went round the company.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An&rsquo; here,&rsquo; went on old Daniel, still
conning the prize-list, &lsquo;here be Jack Farley wi&rsquo; bare
money an&rsquo; fower ounces o&rsquo; tobacker&mdash;him as
doan&rsquo;t smoke, an&rsquo; has sixteen i&rsquo; family.&nbsp;
Lor&rsquo;, Jack! how that there deuce-ace do foller ye i&rsquo;
life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jack Farley sat in the draughtiest seat by the door, his
invariable modest choice of station.&nbsp; No one had ever seen
him without a smile on his emaciated, sun-blackened face; and now
he was smiling more determinedly than ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dunno&rsquo;, Dan&rsquo;1,&rsquo; he expostulated
gently.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Twur a real double-six when &rsquo;er
an&rsquo; me come together all they years ago.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
th&rsquo; chillern, <a name="page298"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>they be good throws, every
wan.&nbsp; An&rsquo; that there noo little &rsquo;un,
Dan&rsquo;l&mdash;nauthin&rsquo; o&rsquo; th&rsquo; deuce-ace
about him, I tell ye!&nbsp; But them as putts to sea,
Dan&rsquo;l, they must look fer rough weather, time and
agen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He squared himself and gazed about him as though his weekly
carter-wage of fourteen shillings were as many pounds.&nbsp; Then
he beat his mug upon the table jovially.&nbsp; &lsquo;An&rsquo;
now,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll sing ye &ldquo;Th&rsquo;
Mistletoe Bough!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was the beginning of the real entertainment of the
evening.&nbsp; Vocal music in the Three Thatchers at ordinary
times was accounted a rather disreputable thing&mdash;a mere
tap-room vulgarism&mdash;by the habitual parlour company; but on
certain rare nights in the year, of which this was one, every man
present was expected to sing.&nbsp; One by one now, in Jack
Farley&rsquo;s wake, followed the rest of the assembly, and every
song had a chorus that shook the very roof-beams of the
house.&nbsp; No man thought of looking at the clock until, in the
midst of a doleful melody from the landlord, old Tom Clemmer
suddenly sprang to his one available foot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis th&rsquo; cart!&rsquo; he cried, and made
for the door.&nbsp; In the general stampede after him, I heard
Captain Stallwood&rsquo;s grumbling voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ut bean&rsquo;t right nohow fer people as caan&rsquo;t
use tobacker to draw un away from them as can.&nbsp; <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>I means to
ha&rsquo; that there fower ounces, Dan&rsquo;l.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
Jack Farley&mdash;th&rsquo; ould swab!&mdash;&rsquo;a must make
out as best &rsquo;a can wi&rsquo; th&rsquo;
turkey-burd.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I can see it,&rsquo; said the Reverend,
&lsquo;plainer than the sun in a midday sky.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With a taper at the end of a long cane, I had just ignited the
last of the candles, and the great Christmas-tree stood up before
us, clad, from its bole to its highest twig, in a shimmering
garment of light.&nbsp; We two were alone in the schoolroom, but
beyond the closed door, we knew, was Mr. Weaverly; and, beyond
him again, a sea of expectant faces filling the wide porch, and
stretching out half across the street under the still,
frost-bound night.&nbsp; Every child that was not whispering
excitedly to its neighbour, was crooning to itself with
irrepressible joy; and the sound came to us through the solid
timber like the sound of a bee-hive just going to swarm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now open the door,&rsquo; said the Reverend, getting
into his corner.&nbsp; &lsquo;And if you miss a single thing,
I&rsquo;ll haunt you when I am gone to the end of your miserable
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I turned the key in the lock, and retreated hastily.&nbsp; The
door flung open.&nbsp; I saw the black form of Mr. Weaverly
flicker aside, and expected <a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>the whole room to be invaded in a
minute by an avalanche of scrambling, vociferating mites.&nbsp;
But it did not happen so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not one has come in yet,&rsquo; said I, over the
Reverend&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are just peering in
at the door.&nbsp; I can see thirty faces, perhaps, with thirty
mouths, and twice as many eyes, opened wide; but never a smile
among the lot.&nbsp; How quiet they keep!&nbsp; But now trembling
fingers are coming round the doorposts, and a boot or two has got
beyond the threshold.&nbsp; The reluctant vanguard is being
pressed forward by those behind.&nbsp; They are creeping in now
at last.&nbsp; The crowd has divided, and they are edging up the
room right and left, keeping their shoulders against the
walls.&nbsp; And all the time every wide-open eye remains fixed
upon the tree in awestruck delight.&nbsp; You hear that low
whispering note?&nbsp; They are beginning to find their voices
again, and the girls are at last venturing to let go one
another&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; They are all in now, I think.&nbsp;
At least the room could hardly hold another&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And just as a failing mill-dam begins to ooze, then to trickle
and spurt, and finally, in a moment gives way before the pressing
tide, so the silence now broke down under the flood of child
voices.&nbsp; Shouts and hurrahs, shrill peals of laughter, a
hubbub of delighted commentary, made the <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>rafters
vibrate above us, and the window-glass tremble in its
quarries.&nbsp; Before the din had so far moderated that I could
get my tongue to work again in the old vicar&rsquo;s service,
Weaverly and his satellites were forging ahead with the first
joyful business of the night.</p>
<p>It all comes back to me now&mdash;as I sit alone and late by
my workroom fire&mdash;clearer perhaps than when I was in the
vortex of it all, with the happy voices ringing about me, and the
toy-drums and trumpets, the mouth-organs and the whistle-pipes,
each going to swell the already deafening chorus the moment it
was cut from the tree and put into some eager, uplifted
hand.&nbsp; I can see the great glittering pyramid of the tree
slowly giving up its treasures, until it bears nothing but the
queen-doll waving her star-tipped wand up among the flags and
paper chains and holly garlands of the ceiling.&nbsp; I see
Weaverly, poised on the top of the rickety ladder, gingerly
dislodging her from her perch, while two overdressed and
over-perfumed ladies hold the ladder firm below, and gaze up at
him with fond and anxious eyes.</p>
<p>Now at last I see the Christmas-tree deserted, forgotten,
while the tables at the end of the room are unloading themselves
of their cakes and oranges and the score of other items
appertaining to the feast.&nbsp; This is a silent time, save for
the <a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>exploding crackers and occasional shrieks of fearsome
delight; but it is over at last.&nbsp; The games begin, and with
them reawakens all the old turmoil in redoubled fury.&nbsp;
Though each of us has eaten more than is credible in any but a
Downland-bred child, this in no way impairs our agility.&nbsp; We
hunt the slipper; we sing ourselves hoarse with &lsquo;Green
Gravel&rsquo;; we play &lsquo;Blind Man&rsquo;s Buff,&rsquo; and
the Reverend, being caught, is allowed to go through the part of
Blind Man, at his own jovial suggestion, without the handkerchief
over his eyes.</p>
<p>And now two things come back to me more significant than
all.&nbsp; But for this busy quarter of an hour&mdash;when he is
staggering to and fro, clutching at pinafores and shock heads of
hair&mdash;the Reverend has been rather a silent and deliberate
figure in the midst of all the madcap business, more detached and
quiet than I have known him at other Christmas gaieties
bygone.&nbsp; He has hovered about on the fringe of the
merrymaking, happy-faced as ever, yet with a certain slowness, a
languor, that I have never marked in him before.&nbsp; This is
the one thing.&nbsp; The other is a random glance I take over my
shoulder at the Christmas-tree, when the fun and frolic are at
their highest.&nbsp; Pathetically forlorn and deserted it looks,
with bits of string clinging here and there to its drooping green
fronds, a single <a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>shining trinket hanging forgotten on one of its lower
branches, and half its glory already quenched.&nbsp; As I look at
it, every moment sees another candle gutter out and die.&nbsp; A
few minutes more, I think, and it will be nothing but a sombre
and solemn fir-tree again, ready to be carted down and set once
more amidst the silent glooms of the wood.&nbsp; Somehow, in
spite of myself, the two things, the two thoughts, blend
themselves indivisibly together.&nbsp; I am glad now that, while
through the long evening I poured into the Reverend&rsquo;s
patient ear much idle chatter and many feather-brained conceits,
I said no word to him about the dying Christmas-tree.</p>
<p>While I have been sitting here, turning over these thoughts,
my own candles have burned low: the wood-fire has sunk to a few
waning embers: it must be growing late, how late I do not guess
until I turn to look at the clock.&nbsp; Almost midnight!&nbsp;
Another minute or two, and then&mdash;Christmas morning!&nbsp;
Perhaps, as the night is so clear and still, I shall be able to
hear the hour chime in far-off Stavisham.&nbsp; I go to the
window, throw back the casement against the rustling ivy, and
look forth.</p>
<p>There is the glimmer of a lantern over by the Seven Sisters on
the green, and a sound of people talking quietly together.&nbsp;
I think I can distinguish George Artlett&rsquo;s deep tones, and
his <a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>brother Tom&rsquo;s&mdash;the Singing
Plowman&rsquo;s&mdash;higher, clearer speech, and an admonitory
word or two that might be Weaverly&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The clock is
striking now.&nbsp; Before its last droning note dies on the
frosty air, the darkness beneath me fills with a living, joyous
music:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Hark! the herald angels sing <br />
Glory to the new-born King,<br />
Peace on earth, and mercy mild, <br />
God and sinners reconciled.&nbsp; <br />
Joyful all ye nations, rise, <br />
Join the triumph of the skies;<br />
With the angelic host proclaim, <br />
&ldquo;Christ is born in Bethlehem.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hark! the herald angels sing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glory to the new-born King!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
